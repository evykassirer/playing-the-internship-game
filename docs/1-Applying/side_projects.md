## Side projects

- If you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills
- These don't have to be big or take too long to do! It's totally okay to make something assignment sized that takes less than a week of work, or a few hours on a weekend.
- If you don't feel like you have the skills to make something yet, or don't have any ideas, you can take a short online course that involves a project!
- Projects are important when you don't have work experience yet, but they're not as essential once you have work experience on your resume
- **PLEASE PLEASE please don't spend all your time on coding projects unless that's just how you like to spend your time** you don't have to do side projects to be successful even though it often is talked about as if you do

You don’t have to build something super fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this [Udacity web development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253)) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You’ll be surprised how complicated “simple projects” can be and how much you can learn. That’s what employers want to see.
