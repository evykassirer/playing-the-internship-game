## Experiences outside work

New place, new experience, new opportunities!

- If you're in a new city, exploring can be really fun!
- Meetup.com to meet new people, share interests and learn new things!
- A nice thing about jobs v.s. school is that you don't have homework when you get back home. This means it's a great time to pick up a new hobby, especially recurring ones

> e.g. (Rudi) I started rock climbing during an internship, the mix of exercise, problem solving, and non-competitiveness makes this sport appealing to a lot of techies

> I also like to look on Groupon for events and things to do in my area. While the main purpose of the site is discounts, it does a pretty good job at aggregating that sort of stuff.
