## Coworker Relationships

> One thing no one tells you early in your career is how insanely valuable your coworker relationships become *after* you leave a company.

> They know your strengths & can call your bullshit. And once you're no longer coworkers, work-related complications/considerations disappear.

> Friends you haven't worked with are great for encouragement, but when it comes to your career, no one knows you like former coworkers (duh).
