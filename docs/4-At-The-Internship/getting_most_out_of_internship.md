## Getting the most out of your internship

New experience, new opportunities!

### Outside of work

- If you're in a new city, exploring can be really fun!
- Meetup.com to meet new people, share interests and learn new things!
- A nice thing about jobs v.s. school is that you don't have homework when you get back home. This means it's a great time to pick up a new hobby, especially recurring ones

> e.g. (Rudi) I started rock climbing during an internship, the mix of exercise, problem solving, and non-competitiveness makes this sport appealing to a lot of techies
> I also like to look on Groupon for events and things to do in my area. While the main purpose of the site is discounts, it does a pretty good job at aggregating that sort of stuff.

### At work

Since you might be working on larger codebases than you're used to or you might get to work in a team with other people, having a couple extra learning goals can help you get the most out of your internship.

- Ask to [pair program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with more experienced engineers once in a while, to learn how they think, what tricks they have and what tools of the trade they use
- Get proficient in the tools that you're using (version control, terminal commands, IDE refactoring features, text editor shortcuts, etc) since you'll get to use them more heavily than on your side projects, so it's a good time to build some muscle memory and ask questions when you have them
