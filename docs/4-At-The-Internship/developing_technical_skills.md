## Developing technical skills at work

Since you might be working on larger codebases than you're used to or you might get to work in a team with other people, having a couple extra learning goals can help you get the most out of your internship.

- Get proficient in the tools that you're using (version control, terminal commands, IDE refactoring features, text editor shortcuts, etc) since you'll get to use them more heavily than on your side projects, so it's a good time to build some muscle memory and ask questions when you have them
