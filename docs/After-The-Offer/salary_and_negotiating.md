## Salary and negotiation

In general, it's a lot easier to be picky about salary once you already have job experience. If this is your first job, and you can afford to not worry about how much make, I would recommend just taking what you're offered.

One thing to remember is cost of living. **In some cities the cost of living is really high**. I've heard stories of people working for startups in SF and making net negative money after paying rent.

If you have work experience and you're being offered less than you've made before, I would consider letting the company know that: "I'm really excited about your offer, but I just wanted to let you know that in the past I've been paid _____. Would it be possible to bring my compensation to a similar level?"

Also, if you have another offer that's offering more money, you can let the other companies know that - sometimes they will match it!

When I ask for more money, I not to make it seem like it's a strong deciding factor for me (because it's not) but that it's just something I'm thinking about.

It's better to talk about salary on the phone (I know, phone calls suck - but this is how people do it and it'll probably give you the best chance. Write a script, it'll help)
