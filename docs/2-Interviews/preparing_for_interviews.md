## Preparing for interviews

There are lots of resources out there to learn more about how to prepare for technical interviews, so I'm just gonna mostly link to resources here (see below). A lot of this stuff feels like a game - you just have to know the rules, the patterns, develop certain skills from repetition. Once you understand the game, you can play it well. You just have to *know how*.

Be prepared to:

- talk about past experience (projects, work)
  - what you did
  - what you liked
  - what you didn't like
  - a technical problem you encountered and how you fixed it
- talk about and work towards writing an algorithm to solve a problem, during the interview
- you can also expect a “tell me about yourself” question (so be prepared!) and some time where they tell you about their company

### Practice makes perfect!

But **please please please** don't overdo it. It's so easy to feel like you can just keep preparing and studying and getting better - you can sink hours and hours and days and weeks into this, and it's not worth it. Being happy, spending time with friends, doing your assignments, etc are all very important. Definitely practice, it will help you feel more comfortable. But don't let it take over your life.

If you can find friends or friendly people who are willing to interview you to help you practice, that is very valuable. Practice talking out loud and going through a problem from beginning to end.

### Resources:

Tutorials/books

- Cracking the Coding Interview ([pdf to old version](https://inspirit.net.in/books/placements/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf) or you can buy it). This is the classic book. In addition to practice problems, the newer versions also cover most of the material that can show up in an interview.
- Elements of Programming Interviews (less up-to date than CtCI but they have a few design problems if you need more advanced practice)
- Programming Interviews Exposed
- [Online course-version of Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview)

Practice coding questions

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) for online practice questions.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for online practice questions.
- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) for the full interview experience. They match you with a peer and you take turns interviewing each other.
