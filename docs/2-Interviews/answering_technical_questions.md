## Answering technical questions

Algorithms questions

- speak loudly, clearly, and confident
- make eye contact if you're doing an in person interview
- get started right away (on something) - don’t think to yourself, or go back and forth on things
- ask questions!!
  - clarify the problem to make sure you know what you're being asked (explain it back)
  - clarify assumptions (ask about edge cases, or clarifying details)
  - ask for requirements/details (e.g. shuffle a deck of cards - do I know how many cards? what does shuffling mean in this case?)
  - go over 1-2 small test cases to make sure you know how the algorithm will work
- explain your thoughts
  - just keep talking, even if you're not sure if you're right. they want to know how you struggle just as much as (if not more than) they want to see you just "get it"
  - before you start coding, explain approach/flow in mind and ask if you’re on the right track/same page
  - write stuff down as you think so they can see you can organize your thoughts
- get a good idea of the design of how it’s going to work before you code it, especially if the coding will be easy but coming up with the right code will be hard (which is an ideal question)
- keep a good pace (keep in mind how long you have and how much you're aiming to get done ... but not too much cause it can be sort of terrifying)
- it’s okay to start with brute force! just get started, you can optimize things later - better to get a simple solution than no solution
- it’s definitely not about getting the right answer right away - any good coder will eventually write code to do it - it’s about getting there within time restraints and the process that got you there
- once you get a draft going, ask if any further optimizations are necessary
  - are you optimizing for time? space? which is more important?
- write/talk through some test cases if you have time, to prove to yourself and the interviewer that your code works
  - consider [edge cases](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/72761/how-do-you-identify-edge-cases-on-algorithms)!

Questions about your experience/projects

- be excited about what you did!
- talk about technical aspects and explain the things *you* did and what you learned


Whiteboard tips

- I hate this, but sometimes you have to write code on the whiteboard. If this comes up, I recommend you...
- start as high up as you can, to give yourself room
- leave some space between function calls and the "first line" because there's a good chance you're going to want to go back to initialize some variables there
- in general, leave some space between lines just in case
- use helper functions as much as possible so you can write different parts of the algorithm in different parts of the board and keep track of what parts do what
- PRACTICE THIS is you know you're going to have to do it - it's really weird and different from writing code on your laptop
