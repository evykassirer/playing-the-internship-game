## When to apply

If you're applying for summer internship and want to go to a big or well known company, often you'll need to apply September/October-ish the year before. Yes, this is early. Yes, this is too early. Yes, it's ridiculous. Pretty much, companies figure that if they extend you an offer before everyone else, you'll be more likely to work there. But then everywhere has been doing this and then if you wait until January the intern class will be full.

However, there are also a lot of companies that will keep hiring in the new year, and some that only start hiring in the new year.

Smaller companies like startups (check out [AngelList](https://angel.co/)) might only be able to know for sure if they can afford an intern when it's a month or two before the internship would start, so don't worry if it's getting late - there are always jobs. We're lucky to be in tech because of how many job opportunities there are!

If you're applying for internships in the fall or winter, 4 months before is probably plenty of time. If you're a Waterloo student and have an internship for 4 months then school for 4 months, and then another internship - I'd recommend applying during the internship and not during school. Interviews during midterms are just too much. It's an amazing feeling to already have a job while watching all your peers stress out about job apps ;D
