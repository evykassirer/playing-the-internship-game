That's why in other fields, there's a lot of entry-level positions with menial work that people take just to get their foot in the door.\n\n\nFortunately for us, tech is unique that there's tons and tons of information on the Internet that people have put out freely.

Furthermore, knowing where people disagree can help you make balanced decisions and empathize.\n\n\n\n\nEvy says: I honestly don't read much tech news. I tend to choose my reading based on things my friends share on Facebook and Twitter, and things my coworkers share on Slack. Though that sometimes includes tech news, I definitely don't go out of my way to find it. I think enough about tech at my day job and am happy to learn more there if needed. Tech news is full of clutter and mean words and lots of things I don't know that overwhelm me. However, I'm privileged to be taken fairly seriously at this point my career with what I've done so far, which allows me to not think as much about tech outside of what I want to read and work on.

It's effectively the barometer of what the tech industry think is trendy. While not at all perfect, and often full of comments by people who think they know more than they do, there are also occasional deep and \ninsightful comments by domain experts\n that you can't find anywhere else. Hiring and interviews is a topic that shows up often, and you'll get to hear opinions and tips from people all over the industry.\n\n\nLobste.rs\n: Similar to Hacker News, but with a smaller community and more focused exclusively on tech. Good if you want to escape the occasional political debates of HN.\n\n\nQuora\n: There's a lot of good and accomplished writers on Quora. Besides learning about tech, Quora is a good place to hear stories from a wide variety of people outside our immediate environment (lawyers, doctors, soldiers, social worker, etc), so it's a decent way to poke your head out of the tech bubble. The amount of noise has gone up in recent years as the site grew, so you'll have to follow the right topics/people, but there's still a lot of good stuff there.\n\n\n/r/cscareerquestions\n: As the name suggests, more directly relevant to finding internships. The signal-to-noise ratio isn't always great, but it can be useful especially if this is your first time looking into tech internships.\n\n\nJoel on Software\n: One of the earliest tech blogs. He writes well and talks a lot about software engineering in the real world, the impact of technical decisions, and other useful insights that you can't really get from working on side projects.\n\n\nPaul Graham\n: One of the most influential figures in the Silicon Valley startup scene. A lot of vocabulary, terminology people and \"commonly accepted truths\" come from his essays, so it's a very useful read if you want to learn the \"startup language\". There's some controversial opinions in there but he does go in more depth in his essays than most bloggers.\n\n\nThe readings are biased towards Silicon Valley tech, but there's a lot of value that software provides to other industries! The volume of public literature tends to be higher in tech so it's fine to start there, but it's not all there is in the world.",

For internships and junior positions especially, all that an employer cares about is \ninterest and willingness to learn\n. Here are different \"signals\" that a side project can convey, sorted roughly by the amount of experience associated with them. \nAny one of these can be interesting for an employer\n!\n\n\nYou can learn a technology on your own\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: You're reading through a book on learning a new language, and applying what you learned by coding a few \nProject Euler\n problems\n\n\nWhy it's useful\n: Most employers will hire you even if you don't know all the technologies that they use, and will expect you to learn some on the job. Here, you've established that you can do that.\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn a concept on your own\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: You got interested in Big Data and read some blog posts about how work can be split up and parallelized to run on multiple machines\n\n\nWhy it's useful\n: Employers sometimes have hard problems to solve and like to know that you can read up on the concepts behind them and help solve them\n\n\n\n\nYou can come up with project ideas\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: You noticed that the school newspaper club manually tallies up survey results into different demographics.

In addition, many companies have proprietary tools that are only available within the company. That's why it doesn't really matter \nwhat\n you learn, as long as you learn \nsomething\n. That signals to employers that you can learn whatever is necessary on the job.\n\n\n\n\nBecoming and staying motivated\n\n\nIt's ideal that you only do side projects if you're enjoying it. That way, it's sustainable, and just a generally healthy thing to do.\n\n\nBut realistically, expect that it can take a few tries to enjoy something. Not all aspects of programming appeal to everyone. It's possible that the stuff you learned in class so far is pretty dry. Some people will enjoy UI/visual/graphics programming. Some people like math and algorithms. Some people like systems. Some people like building products. Some people like to do social good via tech. If you've committed to programming in some way anyway (e.g. enrolled in a CS degree), might as well do some exploration to see what you really like.\n\n\nThis also means that it's totally fine to abandon projects as you find more interesting ones, as long as it helps you learn!\n\n\nProject ideas\n\n\nSee this \ngreat GitHub repo\n with tons of project ideas.\n\n\nOnline courses\n\n\nThis is often the easiest way to start. You don't need to come up with an idea or even know anything, you can just go around shopping for something that looks interesting. We know, we know, you're taking enough classes at school already. But these courses are often more practical, fun, and have more selection.\n\n\nThey can also leave you with something to show in the end. They allow you to build something super fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this \nUdacity web development course\n) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You'll be surprised how complicated \"simple projects\" can be and how much you can learn. That's what employers want to see. So it's good to find courses where the syllabus says you'll have a project completed at the end.\n\n\nPlaces to shop for courses: Udacity, Coursera, EdX.\n\n\nReimplementing stuff\n\n\nA great way to learn how something is built is to build it. Make a much simpler version of Twitter, a BitTorrent, the \nls\n command-line function, a compiler for a small subset of C, etc.\n\n\nSolve a problem you or something you know has\n\n\nGreat ideas come when you notice a problem someone has, that could be solved with software. I don't expect that telling you something vague like this will generate an idea \nright now\n, but if you keep it in the back of your mind, an opportunity might come by!\n\n\nMake a game\n\n\nGames tend to especially satisfying to build because you get to play with it as you go. There are very few constraints, it's very free-form. Along the way, you'll get a chance to learn from a wide range of programming concepts (AI algorithms, OOP design patterns, UI, etc).\n\n\nExample\n\n\nIf you do happen have a lot of time on your hands that you want to spend on side projects, and have something in particular you'd like to work in that you don't have experience in yet, then \nChris Cates\n suggests that you can work on a big project to gain experience. For example:\n\n\n\n\nSay you want to work in AI\n\n\nYou could choose to do research on Tensorflow.\n\n\nYou could fork a Tensorflow project from GitHub (look up \"fork Github\" on Google if you're not sure what that means) and write a wrapper for a specific neural network technique (Alexnet for example).\n\n\nYou could then write a blog post, website demonstrating processes, methodology and use case for the technique.\n\n\nYou can then apply to relevant companies, showcasing the project and case study as an informal cover letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvy: I've never done this. That's more technical work outside of school/jobs than I'd want to do. But it does work for some people!",

But realistically, expect that it can take a few tries to enjoy something. Not all aspects of programming appeal to everyone. It's possible that the stuff you learned in class so far is pretty dry. Some people will enjoy UI/visual/graphics programming. Some people like math and algorithms. Some people like systems. Some people like building products. Some people like to do social good via tech. If you've committed to programming in some way anyway (e.g. enrolled in a CS degree), might as well do some exploration to see what you really like.

You don't need to come up with an idea or even know anything, you can just go around shopping for something that looks interesting. We know, we know, you're taking enough classes at school already. But these courses are often more practical, fun, and have more selection.  They can also leave you with something to show in the end. They allow you to build something super fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this  Udacity web development course ) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You'll be surprised how complicated \"simple projects\" can be and how much you can learn. That's what employers want to see. So it's good to find courses where the syllabus says you'll have a project completed at the end.  Places to shop for courses: Udacity, Coursera, EdX.  Reimplementing stuff  A great way to learn how something is built is to build it. Make a much simpler version of Twitter, a BitTorrent, the  ls  command-line function, a compiler for a small subset of C, etc.  Solve a problem you or something you know has  Great ideas come when you notice a problem someone has, that could be solved with software. I don't expect that telling you something vague like this will generate an idea  right now , but if you keep it in the back of your mind, an opportunity might come by!  Make a game  Games tend to especially satisfying to build because you get to play with it as you go. There are very few constraints, it's very free-form. Along the way, you'll get a chance to learn from a wide range of programming concepts (AI algorithms, OOP design patterns, UI, etc).",

Well-known tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, Airbnb, etc have dedicated recruiting teams, with each individual recruiters assigned to different universities.

This often means that they will have a certain number of intern slots (rough or exact), sometimes split amongst different universities.

Their business is very uncertain and their hiring capacity, needs, projects, business goals, etc, tend to change randomly and quickly. They might only know for sure if they can afford an intern when it's a month or two before the internship would start. While not all startups hire interns, it's worth reaching out to them. We often hear stories of students getting a job at a cool startup at the last minute, right after a slot opened up because the startup got funding (also at the last minute).\n\n\nSmaller companies\n.

They don't have the resources to go campus recruiting and prefer to avoid competing head-on with big-name companies. You may have to send out a lot of emails but many of them will hire later. A lot of these companies might be local, so it's useful to search for tech companies in particular cities.\n\n\nNon-tech companies\n.

Even if they had an unlimited monetary budget, they still need to find full-time employees capable and willing to be intern mentors, as well as projects to give interns. For that reason, every additional intern past a certain number will strain their capacity to provide a good internship experience.

If you're a Waterloo student and have an internship for 4 months then school for 4 months, and then another internship - I'd recommend applying during the internship and not during school. Interviews during midterms are just too much. It's an amazing feeling to already have a job while watching all your peers stress out about job apps ;D  One thing to keep in mind is that companies rarely have intern positions posted on their website outside of standard intern season. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're not interested! You should ask friends for referrals, send out emails to people that work there, etc.",

From the company's perspective, applications received online are lower in quality on average and provide the least amount of information about the applicant. This means that they are less likely to get back to online applicants than applicants they learned about from other places (see below). Many many many people are applying for internships and it's a lot of work to get through all those resumes and select who to interview.

Internally, recruiters give higher weight to applications submitted by an employee at the company.\n\n\nBut realize that every other student they're talking to is also trying to be remembered.

            "text": "Resumes\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nThere are a lot of opinions on resumes. Many of them conflict with each other. Here I'll write about the things I look for when critiquing/writing resumes, but keep in mind it's just my own preference (and I'll try to explain why I feel that way). The main goal of a resume is to advertise yourself as well as possible, so if you feel you can do that better by not following my advice, then go for it!\n\n\nWhy resumes are important\n\n\nThis is only the first step to applying for jobs.\u200aIf you have a weak resume, you don\u2019t even get to the interview part (even if you're super qualified!). So having a good resume is very important. Folks that are hiring often spend only a few seconds looking at your resume, so knowing what they're expecting to see and how to impress them is essential for getting your job.\n\n\nKey goals\n\n\n\n\nGoal: prove you're qualified and would be nice to work with\n\n\nHow you'll do it:\n\n\nmake your resume easy to scan\n\n\nclearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart early!\n\n\nStart on your resume at least a month before applying for jobs so you have time to refine it to be awesome.\n\n\nGet people to critique your resume\n\n\nThis is a verrry important step and why it's good to start early. Go to resume critique sessions if your school holds them and ask your peers or more folks to look over your resume. Post your resume on Facebook and just keep asking people to edit it. I know it's scary to expose yourself like that, but having other people look over your resume is so so useful and helpful. If you can push your comfort levels a little, I think it will be worth it. If other students are critical of your resume, it can be a little disappointing but otherwise, no harm is done. If a recruiter is critical of your resume, you won't get the job and won't even know why!\n\n\nSections in your resume\n\n\nHeader\n\n\n\n\nHere you'll want to put your name, email, and GitHub (if you have one)\n\n\nIf you have a website, link to it\n\n\nMany people put their phone number here, but I don't like being called out of the blue so I don't put my number on my resume - if they need it they can email me and ask for it\n\n\nDon't put your address - no one will mail you in this day and age, and it takes up a bunch of space\n\n\nIf you're early in your education, don't put your term/year/graduation date in the header - it gives you less cred right off the bat (you can put it in the education section lower down)\n\n\n\n\nWork experience\n\n\n\n\nThis should go at the top if you have relevant experience\n\n\nIf you have some work experience, but it's not relevant to tech, you might want to put it on your resume anyways. Put anything tech related above your work experience, and if there's still a bunch of space left, talk about the jobs you've had in the recent past and the skills you used there. There are probably things you did that have skills that translate to working a tech job - leadership, navigating new situations, problem solving, working under pressure, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nWhere this goes depends on how well known your school is and how much it'll help sell you compared to your other projects. In general, the order of sections on your resume should go from most impressive (and therefore likely to get you to the next stage) to least impressive, since whoever is reading your resume will likely scan it from top to bottom and might make a decision before they get to the bottom\n\n\nIn general, even if you're from a top school, the name of your school is less interesting than other things you've done\n\n\nIf you're applying through a school specific application process (e.g. Waterloo's coop system), definitely put it near the bottom. Everyone has the same education which not only means that it doesn't make your resume stand out at all, it's basically redundant information\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills.\n\n\nSee \nthe page on side projects\n for more info\n\n\nIf you have a lot of projects, pick your favourite 3-4 for your resume; it might seem like having 7 projects looks impressive but unless they're all super impressive it just looks like filler - on your resume you always want quality over quantity\n\n\n\n\nAwards / Scholarships\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any impressive looking awards/scholarships, definitely mention them\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer experience\n\n\n\n\nThis is especially helpful if you have less work experience\n\n\nIn my first year of school, I volunteered at some CS workshops (less than a day's commitment each) and put those on my resume\n\n\n\n\nSmall section for your other interests\n\n\n\n\nI like to put that I sing in choirs and involved with certain clubs - it's important to me to have a life outside of CS-y things, and many employers appreciate this too. Some will talk about them a bit during interviews to break the ice!\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: You don't need all these sections and don't have to do them the way I advise!! Think about what skills you have that you can bring to this job, and find the things in your life that most prove you're qualified and figure out the best way to organize those things on your resume. Everyone is different, so everyone has a slightly different resume that will advertise them best.\n\n\nI'd recommend checking out other people's resumes too, as some of them have sections in their resumes that I don't personally use - these are just the sections that I like and work best for me.\n\n\nShow don't tell\n\n\nAs much as possible, don't list your skills without context proving you have them. Anyone can write \"good communicator\" on their resume, and unless you talk about something you did that needed very good communication skills, that line is essentially useless. In general, just don't list \"good communicator\" as a skill and instead talk about your communication skills when you talk about your experience. This is also true for a lot of soft skills such as \"effective team member\" or \"strong personal leadership\".\n\n\nSimilarily, show that you know programming languages by mentioning them in the work you've done with them and don't just list a bunch of them at the top of your resume. It can be useful to have them all in one place of course. But ideally, languages/technologies/acronyms that you put in a list should also appear elsewhere on your resume.\n\n\nWe say ideally because you might have dabbled in some new technology just to try it (e.g. some framework, language, programming tool, API, etc). You might not have completed a project with it and don't know how you'd write about it on your resume. However, you probably still learned something from it and that still signals to the employers that you can learn on your own which is great (\nsee side projects\n). It's fine to include them, as long as you are able to explain how you've used them during an interview if asked. In general, you should be able to talk about anything on your resume during an interview.\n\n\nLength\n\n\nOne page is generally considered best, but I've had a two page resume in the past and know plenty of people that have done well with two page resumes. In general, I'd say if you have a two page resume, you should make sure it's okay if they only read the first page (i.e. the second page is like \"bonus extra stuff about me\").\n\n\nI like the idea of the one page resume because (1) people might not look at it long enough to even see the second page and (2) if you spread out your information accross two pages, you'll probably have less concentration of the good stuff. If you have a 2+ page resume, pick your best selling points accross those multiple pages and put just those on one page.\n\n\nIn general, it might seem like writing more will make you seem more impressive, but if you write tons and tons only to fill space, it won't be impressive because it will be obvious that it's just filler. Short resumes clearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications and are easier for a recruiter or potential employer to scan and understand. You do not want to dilute your impressive accomplishments in a sea of boring details!\n\n\nHow do you know if you're being too verbose? If you do have a two-page resume, you should definitely at least do the exercise of shortening it until it fits into one page. Just think of it as a way to practice being concise, and ask your friends to cross out what they think is the least interesting if needed. You might not like the end result and decide not to keep it. That's fine. But you might also find out that it works just fine.\n\n\nFor more tips on shortening resumes, see \nresume information density\n.\n\n\nHow to talk about things\n\n\n\n\nuse action verbs - they help describe the skills you've used, and starting bullet points with them helps keep your descriptions short and powerful - Google \"action verbs\" to find a bunch of lists of words to use\n\n\nadd dates when possible - for work experience, projects, volunteering, etc.\n\n\nbullet points should be concise and easy to scan, so ideally only one line long and rarely longer than two lines\n\n\nif you have more than 4 bullet points for one section, it'll become a big block of text and will become harder to scan as well. You should rarely need that many bullet points\n\n\n\n\nFormatting\n\n\nConsistency:\n\n\n\n\nuse periods at the end of bullet points or don't, but don't mix them\n\n\nmake sure your dates are in the same format (e.g. Aug 2017 or September '17)\n\n\nin general, the way you format each section and the way you talk about things should be consistent - this makes it easy to find information and to scan your resume\n\n\nin case you're thinking this right now - yes I could have better consistency in this guide because I'm not alawys doing the things I literally just mentioned ...but it's a lot harder for a thing this big and I guess I don't care enough ^.^\n\n\n\n\nGrammar:\n- \nIt matters a lot\n\n- One more reason to get your resume reviewed by peers\n\n\nKeep it simple:\n\n\n\n\nThe more different formatting styles there are (bold, italics, different text sizes, different fonts, different colours, use of capital letters) the more work your brain does to make sense of it all. Having a few styles is helpful for differentiating headings/bullet points/important words (if you want), but keep it minimal or your resume becomes harder to scan\n\n\n\n\nLink to stuff!\n\n\nI'm all about hyperlinks everywhere.\n\n\nIf you have projects on GitHub (if you don't, but have proejcts, make an account and put them on GitHub!) link to it at the top of your resume, but also link to your project in that section on your resume.\n\n\nIf you've written a blog post about a project, link to it. If you have a website, link to it at the top of your resume. Add your linkedin. Add your email. Make it all clickable! If you worked at a company that has a website, link to that too.\n\n\nIf you really want someone to be able to visit your link, even if they've printed your resume, make a short link (so it's easier to copy out) and explictly paste it in your resume. In other places you can just hyperlink text as bonus information if someone happens to hover over that area.\n\n\nDo not overoptimize\n\n\nAlthough resumes are super important, there will be diminishing returns on the amount of time you spend optimizing your resume. If people don't seem to be making major suggestions anymore after a few rounds of review, maybe it's time to move on.\n\n\nDon't forget: the advice presented here is about presenting your existing accomplishments effectively. But time that you spend optimizing your resume could also be spent generating stuff to put on your resume, which is more valuable in the long run! (learning a new language, making a project, etc)\n\n\nMisc\n\n\nMake sure you can print your resume\n\n\n\n\nMargins should be wide enough that things aren't cut off.\n\n\nIf you use colour, make sure it prints clearly enough in black and white.\n\n\n\n\nOn how old your points can be\n\n\nOnce you're 2 years into university, I'd say don't talk about high school at all unless (1) you have very few things to say about your last two years or (2) your high school accomplishments are extremely impressive\n\n\nMore resources about resumes\n\n\n\n\nsomething I wrote a while ago about resumes\n (there's some stuff I haven't put here yet)\n\n\nmy resume if you're curious what it looks like\n\n\ntips from Gayle McDowell",

Put anything tech related above your work experience, and if there's still a bunch of space left, talk about the jobs you've had in the recent past and the skills you used there. There are probably things you did that have skills that translate to working a tech job - leadership, navigating new situations, problem solving, working under pressure, etc.   Education   Where this goes depends on how well known your school is and how much it'll help sell you compared to your other projects. In general, the order of sections on your resume should go from most impressive (and therefore likely to get you to the next stage) to least impressive, since whoever is reading your resume will likely scan it from top to bottom and might make a decision before they get to the bottom  In general, even if you're from a top school, the name of your school is less interesting than other things you've done  If you're applying through a school specific application process (e.g. Waterloo's coop system), definitely put it near the bottom. Everyone has the same education which not only means that it doesn't make your resume stand out at all, it's basically redundant information   Projects   If you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills.  See  the page on side projects  for more info  If you have a lot of projects, pick your favourite 3-4 for your resume; it might seem like having 7 projects looks impressive but unless they're all super impressive it just looks like filler - on your resume you always want quality over quantity   Awards / Scholarships   If you have any impressive looking awards/scholarships, definitely mention them   Volunteer experience   This is especially helpful if you have less work experience  In my first year of school, I volunteered at some CS workshops (less than a day's commitment each) and put those on my resume   Small section for your other interests   I like to put that I sing in choirs and involved with certain clubs - it's important to me to have a life outside of CS-y things, and many employers appreciate this too. Some will talk about them a bit during interviews to break the ice!   Note : You don't need all these sections and don't have to do them the way I advise!! Think about what skills you have that you can bring to this job, and find the things in your life that most prove you're qualified and figure out the best way to organize those things on your resume.

            "text": "Answering technical questions\n\n\nForeword\n\n\nThis section contains a lot of information and can look very daunting. \nYou don't need to know everything in here to interview!\n. The good news is that a lot of these will probably come to you naturally as you practice and get experience interviewing. It's totally expected that the first few interviews are going to involve some learning! There's no substitute to practice. The goal of this section is \nnot to memorize it\n, but to use it as a \nguide to help you reflect\n on your experience and help you improve in the long run.\n\n\nWhich language should I use?\n\n\nThe best answer to this question is \"whatever you're the most comfortable with\". In 99% of algorithm interviews, they want to see if you understand programming concepts and can write code. You can show that to them in just about any language. Using the language you are most familiar with will minimize friction, such as unfamiliarity with the language and its libraries.\n\n\nThat being said, some languages allow you to express concepts much more quickly and ergonomically than others, and eventually you'll want to get comfortable with one of those languages. We recommend Python in particular \nfor interviews\n (though it's also a useful language to know in general).\n\n\nThings that can get in the way in other languages include:\n- Writing types (we love types, but you only have one hour to write your code and explain it!)\n- Manual memory management (tedious and error-prone)\n- Verbose syntax  (using Python will usually result in much less writing, which saves so much time)\n- Boilerplate code\n  - Class definitions, keywords like public or static\n  - Writing conversions between conceptually similar data structures (e.g. a library function returns \nString[]\n, you want \nList\nString\n)\n  - Simple tasks like creating a set out of the elements of an array\n- Writing uninteresting subroutines (e.g. manually iterating over an array to find the max element or to do a linear search)\n\n\nSearch for \nPython tricks\n to find \nuseful shortcuts\n.\n\n\nThere are other languages that are quite ergonomic, like Ruby and some functional languages. But Python is the most widely understood and useful outside of interviews.\n\n\n\n\nEvy says: When I started using Python, I started passing interviews at a much higher rate. Yes, I was also more experienced, but I was a lot less worried about \"using the language right\" and having enough time to put my ideas into code. I spent a few weeks practicing algorithms in Python and looking at sample solutions to see what kinds of helpful shortcuts I could use, and then I was set!\n\n\nRudi says: sometimes the interviewer might specify which language you have to use. You don't really have a choice but to comply to their demands. However, for algorithm questions, it's not a great sign unless they have a good and specific justification. While all programmers begin programming by learning a programming language, transferring concepts between programming languages is not very difficult once you've used 2 or 3.\n\n\nRudi says: some questions are better suited for some languages than others. For example, you can better communicate that you understand low-level concepts if you use C++ than Python. However, often times, you can still get the concepts across in a high-level language, and just mention why it would be more efficient in a low-level language. I've once implemented a garbage collector in Python during an interview and did pointer arithmetics on Python integers while pretending they were pointers. It was basically pseudo-code that actually ran and worked. But it's something I'd never do in real life, there would be no situation where it would make sense!\n\n\n\n\nGeneral communication tips\n\n\n\n\nSpeak loudly, clearly, and confidently\n\n\nBeing confident does not mean being confident that you are always right or that your code is guaranteed to work. A confident person is also comfortable communicating that there are things that they don't know, and places where they could be mistaken.\n\n\nIt's hard to 'teach' being confident, but seeing examples might help gain awareness (see the \"Other resources\" below)\n\n\nMake eye contact if you're doing an in-person interview\n\n\nPractice shaking hands with friends if needed, to get a sense of what a good, firm handshake looks like\n\n\nExplain what you're thinking and doing throughout the interview\n\n\nUsing clear variable names and even writing comments while coding is part of communication. It helps the interviewer follow what you're doing, and it demonstrates a care for quality code, which is valued in the workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRudi says: Communication is a difficult life skill to master. We're not saying that you have to worry about how much you talk at any point in the interview. That would be super stressful and trip you up! Rather, we only mean that this is something to keep in mind and improve in the long term. Also, it's more important to become good at solving the problem at first than focus on perfecting your delivery. I know it's really hard to think about clear communication when your brain is 100% focused on solving the question! I can't do it. The more comfortable you become with solving the question, the more bandwidth you'll free up to think about other things.\n\n\nEvy says: When I solve a problem in my head, I often think in words, which makes it easier to just verbalize that process to an interviewer. Lucky, right? I know not everyone thinks this way, but I think practicing verbalizing your thought process will help, even if you're unsure about things. You can practice this for coding algorithms, but you can also practice when solving every day life problems :)\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms: starting the interview\n\n\n\n\nState what language you intend to use. Many C-style (curly brace) languages look similar but have subtle difference\n\n\nGet started right away (on something)\n\n\nDon't think to yourself, or go back and forth on things for too long. It's perfectly fine to take a few minutes to time to think in the beginning, but interviewers want to see things moving at some point\n\n\nYou don't have to get \ncoding\n right away. In fact, you probably shouldn't\n\n\nSome things you can start with is to ask questions, draw some examples, describe possible approaches, write pseudocode\n\n\nAsk questions!!!\n\n\nClarify the problem to make sure you know what you're being asked (explain it back)\n\n\nClarify requirements and assumptions (ask about edge cases, or clarifying details). E.g. shuffle a deck of cards - do I know how many cards? what does shuffling mean in this case?\n\n\nGo over 1-2 small test cases to make sure you know how the algorithm will work\n\n\nNote: figuring out what to ask is something you learn over time. Typical questions include: \"what is the input size?\", \"is the input sorted?\", \"can I assume the input is always valid/well-formatted?\", \"how much memory do I have?\".\n\n\nExplain to the interviewer how you intend to approach and solve the problem at a conceptual level before you start writing code\n\n\nIt helps you clarify your own thoughts\n\n\nIt helps the interviewer follow along when you start coding\n\n\nIt allows the interviewer to correct you if you misunderstood the question\n\n\nIt allows the interviewer to jump in if the solution is totally off-track. Better to know early on before you write too much code going down the wrong path!\n\n\nWrite stuff down as you think so they can see that you can organize your thoughts\n\n\nIt's okay to start with an inefficient approach, even brute force! Just get started, you can optimize things later - better to get a simple solution than no solution. Just don't forget to tell the interviewer that you're going for the brute force route. You don't want the interviewer to think that you think O(c^n) solution is efficient. So just tell the interviewer that you are aware that this is not the most efficient solution, but that writing even an inefficient approach will give you insight into the problem\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms: solving the problem\n\n\n\n\nExplain your thought process throughout the interview. The interviewer also wants to know how you think, and what's going on in your mind throughout the interview (it's okay to verbalize feelings of nervousness too!). And sometimes, it helps just because interviews can be uncomfortable with long silences, they're humans too!\n\n\nIt's perfectly fine to take time to think. Just state it. The point is to avoid suddenly going silent. Useful phrases include \"I'm going to take a minute to think about possible solutions\" or \"I'm worried that my solution does not handle this edge case. Let me think about this for a minute\". Think of it as if you were narrating your own thought process: \"I am wondering whether I should use approach A or approach B\"\n\n\nAlways explain what you are coding next. It doesn't have to be a long-winded explanation, often a sentence is enough. For example, \"next, I'm going to find the object in this array with the largest index\" before writing the 3-5 lines of code that achieves it. This can be helpful if you are going in the wrong direction. If finding the object in the array with the largest index won't help you solve the problem, your interviewer might pipe in and encourage you to try something else before you waste time coding it up\n\n\nThere's a natural fear of being judged for saying something wrong, but it's often fine to keep talking even if you're not sure that you're right. Interviewers often want to know how you struggle just as much as (if not more than) they want to see you just \"get it\"\n\n\nOne way to practice this is to do problems on a whiteboard or sheet of paper and \ntalk to a rubber duck\n\n\nKeep a good pace (keep in mind how long you have and how much you're aiming to get done ... but not too much cause it can be sort of terrifying)\n\n\nIt's definitely not about getting the right answer right away - any good coder will eventually write code to do it - it's about the process that got you there and getting there within time constraints\n\n\nMake sure you handle common edge cases, like an empty input! People always forget that\n\n\n\n\nA common question students ask is \n\"am I allowed to use library functions?\"\n (e.g. find element in array). The answer is \nprobably yes\n. However:\n- If the library solves the question in one line, the interviewer probably wants you to implement it to see if you understand how it works. Feel free to mention that an implementation already exist, but just don't start complaining about how you wouldn't do it in real-life (it's not the point)\n- Do explain very clearly the input and outputs of the function you are using, and when possible how it's implemented or what kind of tricky behavior it might have\n- Just to make sure, it's worth asking permission, or at least make sure the interviewer knows what the function is\n- It's fine to make up a function if you can't remember what the existing one is called. Nobody cares if you use \nFile.open(...)\n when it's supposed to be \nSys.open_file(...)\n\n\nOn that subject, a very useful bit of preparation that can only take an hour or two is to familiarize yourself with the libraries that come with your language. It's worth reading over the operations you can do on strings, arrays/lists and maps/dictionaries. Useful functions include \nzip\n, \nsplit\n, \nsubstr\n/\nslice\n, \njoin\n, \nfind\n, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEvy says: before interviews, I summarize all this functions on a few sheets of paper and print them out and get familiar with where certain functions are on the sheets. If I'm doing a phone screening, I put the papers up above my laptop so I can refer to them. But I've also had interviews where I say \"oh I know there's a function for that but forget what its name is - can I Google it?\" and they either say yes or say I can just make it up. Google will always be available at work, so it's unreasonable to ask you to program in an interview as if it wasn't available.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms: finishing the interview\n\n\n\n\nWrite/talk through some test cases if you have time, to prove to yourself and the interviewer that your code works\n\n\nOnce you have an initial implementation mostly right, ask if any further optimizations are necessary\n\n\nAre you optimizing for time? Space? Which is more important?\n\n\nOffer to make further improvements the code. This tends to impress interviewers\n\n\nHow can the style of your code be improved?\n\n\nIs there any redudancy that could be eliminated?\n\n\nCould you refactor your solution to be more generalized? e.g. accept an arbitrary iterable data structure as an input when the question just asked you to handle arrays\n\n\nCan you write the solution more concisely? e.g. you used a bunch of for loops when you could have used map/filter/reduce\n\n\nVolunteering to do this also impresses interviewers, because it shows that you take responsibility for making sure your code is correct\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms: advanced tips\n\n\n\n\nImplement functions in breadth-first order, not depth-first order\n\n\nFor example, supposed you have your main function f1 that calls f2 and f3. Function f2 calls f4. An effective implementation order is f1, f2, f3, f4. Don't implement part of f1, jump to f2, then f3, and end up coming back to f1 later. You'll lose track of what you were doing. Instead, just call the functions, explaining to the interviewer what the function does and promise that you'll implement it after you're done with your current function\n\n\nThis also optimizes the time you have. If you don't get to writing some of your helper functions that implement the details, the overall general solution will still be coded out in full\n\n\nIf the solution to a problem is already familiar to you or you can find the solution instantly, be careful not to code it directly without any explanations\n\n\nThere's a danger that the interviewer will think you just memorized the solution, which doesn't provide them much information about your problem solving-abilities. You should probably also tell the interviewer you know the answer from before, that you have already figured it out. They might give you another question, or you might be asked to still implement it, just explaining the solution as you go\n\n\nOtherwise, take extra care to explain the constraints of the problems, the conditions that need to be satisfied for the solution to work, and the reasoning behind each part of the solution. For example, if your solution involves using a set, explain that you need constant-time access, that you don't need to store duplicate elements, that you have no values (keys only) and that order doesn't matter (unless the set implementation in your language guarantees an order)\n\n\nLearn to use the accurate and precise terminology\n\n\nFor example, I've heard people say \"null tree\" when they meant \"empty tree\". In some cases, an empty tree is represented with a null pointer, but the term \"null\" is very language and implementation-specific\n\n\nAnother example is saying that you want to use an ArrayList when discussing what data structure to use. Probably you would want to say either an array or dynamic array, which conveys more information that you understand how ArrayList is implemented and what the performance implications are\n\n\nThe problem with language-specific terminology is that it may convey that your current understanding of programming is mostly tied to a particular language\n\n\n\n\nQuestions about your experience/projects\n\n\n\n\nbe excited about what you did!\n\n\ntalk about technical aspects and explain the things \nyou\n did and what you learned\n\n\n\n\nWhiteboard tips\n\n\n\n\nI hate this, but sometimes you have to write code on the whiteboard. If this comes up, I recommend you...\n\n\nstart as high up as you can, to give yourself room\n\n\nleave some space between function calls and the \"first line\" because there's a good chance you're going to want to go back to initialize some variables there\n\n\nin general, leave some space between lines just in case\n\n\nuse helper functions as much as possible so you can write different parts of the algorithm in different parts of the board and keep track of what parts do what\n\n\nPRACTICE THIS if you know you're going to have to do it - it's really weird and different from writing code on your laptop\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nSteve Yegge's blog\n:\n\n\n\n\nOne last non-technical tip: bring your own whiteboard dry-erase markers. They sell pencil-thin ones at office supply stores, whereas most companies (including Google) tend to stock the fat kind. The thin ones turn your whiteboard from a 480i standard-definition tube into a 58-inch 1080p HD plasma screen. You need all the help you can get, and free whiteboard space is a real blessing.\n\n\n\n\nOther resources\n\n\nA video walkthrough of a coding question using some of the tips above\n\n\nYouTube channel on charisma and confidence\n\n\nThe Charisma Myth\n\n\nHow to identify edge cases on algorithms\n!",

            "text": "The best answer to this question is \"whatever you're the most comfortable with\". In 99% of algorithm interviews, they want to see if you understand programming concepts and can write code. You can show that to them in just about any language. Using the language you are most familiar with will minimize friction, such as unfamiliarity with the language and its libraries.  That being said, some languages allow you to express concepts much more quickly and ergonomically than others, and eventually you'll want to get comfortable with one of those languages. We recommend Python in particular  for interviews  (though it's also a useful language to know in general).  Things that can get in the way in other languages include:\n- Writing types (we love types, but you only have one hour to write your code and explain it!)\n- Manual memory management (tedious and error-prone)\n- Verbose syntax  (using Python will usually result in much less writing, which saves so much time)\n- Boilerplate code\n  - Class definitions, keywords like public or static\n  - Writing conversions between conceptually similar data structures (e.g. a library function returns  String[] , you want  List String )\n  - Simple tasks like creating a set out of the elements of an array\n- Writing uninteresting subroutines (e.g. manually iterating over an array to find the max element or to do a linear search)  Search for  Python tricks  to find  useful shortcuts .  There are other languages that are quite ergonomic, like Ruby and some functional languages. But Python is the most widely understood and useful outside of interviews.   Evy says: When I started using Python, I started passing interviews at a much higher rate. Yes, I was also more experienced, but I was a lot less worried about \"using the language right\" and having enough time to put my ideas into code. I spent a few weeks practicing algorithms in Python and looking at sample solutions to see what kinds of helpful shortcuts I could use, and then I was set!  Rudi says: sometimes the interviewer might specify which language you have to use. You don't really have a choice but to comply to their demands. However, for algorithm questions, it's not a great sign unless they have a good and specific justification. While all programmers begin programming by learning a programming language, transferring concepts between programming languages is not very difficult once you've used 2 or 3.  Rudi says: some questions are better suited for some languages than others. For example, you can better communicate that you understand low-level concepts if you use C++ than Python. However, often times, you can still get the concepts across in a high-level language, and just mention why it would be more efficient in a low-level language. I've once implemented a garbage collector in Python during an interview and did pointer arithmetics on Python integers while pretending they were pointers. It was basically pseudo-code that actually ran and worked. But it's something I'd never do in real life, there would be no situation where it would make sense!",

            "text": "Speak loudly, clearly, and confidently  Being confident does not mean being confident that you are always right or that your code is guaranteed to work. A confident person is also comfortable communicating that there are things that they don't know, and places where they could be mistaken.  It's hard to 'teach' being confident, but seeing examples might help gain awareness (see the \"Other resources\" below)  Make eye contact if you're doing an in-person interview  Practice shaking hands with friends if needed, to get a sense of what a good, firm handshake looks like  Explain what you're thinking and doing throughout the interview  Using clear variable names and even writing comments while coding is part of communication. It helps the interviewer follow what you're doing, and it demonstrates a care for quality code, which is valued in the workplace    Rudi says: Communication is a difficult life skill to master. We're not saying that you have to worry about how much you talk at any point in the interview. That would be super stressful and trip you up! Rather, we only mean that this is something to keep in mind and improve in the long term. Also, it's more important to become good at solving the problem at first than focus on perfecting your delivery. I know it's really hard to think about clear communication when your brain is 100% focused on solving the question! I can't do it. The more comfortable you become with solving the question, the more bandwidth you'll free up to think about other things.  Evy says: When I solve a problem in my head, I often think in words, which makes it easier to just verbalize that process to an interviewer. Lucky, right? I know not everyone thinks this way, but I think practicing verbalizing your thought process will help, even if you're unsure about things. You can practice this for coding algorithms, but you can also practice when solving every day life problems :)",

            "text": "State what language you intend to use. Many C-style (curly brace) languages look similar but have subtle difference  Get started right away (on something)  Don't think to yourself, or go back and forth on things for too long. It's perfectly fine to take a few minutes to time to think in the beginning, but interviewers want to see things moving at some point  You don't have to get  coding  right away. In fact, you probably shouldn't  Some things you can start with is to ask questions, draw some examples, describe possible approaches, write pseudocode  Ask questions!!!  Clarify the problem to make sure you know what you're being asked (explain it back)  Clarify requirements and assumptions (ask about edge cases, or clarifying details). E.g. shuffle a deck of cards - do I know how many cards? what does shuffling mean in this case?  Go over 1-2 small test cases to make sure you know how the algorithm will work  Note: figuring out what to ask is something you learn over time. Typical questions include: \"what is the input size?\", \"is the input sorted?\", \"can I assume the input is always valid/well-formatted?\", \"how much memory do I have?\".  Explain to the interviewer how you intend to approach and solve the problem at a conceptual level before you start writing code  It helps you clarify your own thoughts  It helps the interviewer follow along when you start coding  It allows the interviewer to correct you if you misunderstood the question  It allows the interviewer to jump in if the solution is totally off-track. Better to know early on before you write too much code going down the wrong path!  Write stuff down as you think so they can see that you can organize your thoughts  It's okay to start with an inefficient approach, even brute force! Just get started, you can optimize things later - better to get a simple solution than no solution. Just don't forget to tell the interviewer that you're going for the brute force route. You don't want the interviewer to think that you think O(c^n) solution is efficient. So just tell the interviewer that you are aware that this is not the most efficient solution, but that writing even an inefficient approach will give you insight into the problem",

            "text": "Explain your thought process throughout the interview. The interviewer also wants to know how you think, and what's going on in your mind throughout the interview (it's okay to verbalize feelings of nervousness too!). And sometimes, it helps just because interviews can be uncomfortable with long silences, they're humans too!  It's perfectly fine to take time to think. Just state it. The point is to avoid suddenly going silent. Useful phrases include \"I'm going to take a minute to think about possible solutions\" or \"I'm worried that my solution does not handle this edge case. Let me think about this for a minute\". Think of it as if you were narrating your own thought process: \"I am wondering whether I should use approach A or approach B\"  Always explain what you are coding next. It doesn't have to be a long-winded explanation, often a sentence is enough. For example, \"next, I'm going to find the object in this array with the largest index\" before writing the 3-5 lines of code that achieves it. This can be helpful if you are going in the wrong direction. If finding the object in the array with the largest index won't help you solve the problem, your interviewer might pipe in and encourage you to try something else before you waste time coding it up  There's a natural fear of being judged for saying something wrong, but it's often fine to keep talking even if you're not sure that you're right. Interviewers often want to know how you struggle just as much as (if not more than) they want to see you just \"get it\"  One way to practice this is to do problems on a whiteboard or sheet of paper and  talk to a rubber duck  Keep a good pace (keep in mind how long you have and how much you're aiming to get done ... but not too much cause it can be sort of terrifying)  It's definitely not about getting the right answer right away - any good coder will eventually write code to do it - it's about the process that got you there and getting there within time constraints  Make sure you handle common edge cases, like an empty input! People always forget that   A common question students ask is  \"am I allowed to use library functions?\"  (e.g. find element in array). The answer is  probably yes . However:\n- If the library solves the question in one line, the interviewer probably wants you to implement it to see if you understand how it works. Feel free to mention that an implementation already exist, but just don't start complaining about how you wouldn't do it in real-life (it's not the point)\n- Do explain very clearly the input and outputs of the function you are using, and when possible how it's implemented or what kind of tricky behavior it might have\n- Just to make sure, it's worth asking permission, or at least make sure the interviewer knows what the function is\n- It's fine to make up a function if you can't remember what the existing one is called. Nobody cares if you use  File.open(...)  when it's supposed to be  Sys.open_file(...)  On that subject, a very useful bit of preparation that can only take an hour or two is to familiarize yourself with the libraries that come with your language. It's worth reading over the operations you can do on strings, arrays/lists and maps/dictionaries. Useful functions include  zip ,  split ,  substr / slice ,  join ,  find , etc.   Evy says: before interviews, I summarize all this functions on a few sheets of paper and print them out and get familiar with where certain functions are on the sheets. If I'm doing a phone screening, I put the papers up above my laptop so I can refer to them. But I've also had interviews where I say \"oh I know there's a function for that but forget what its name is - can I Google it?\" and they either say yes or say I can just make it up. Google will always be available at work, so it's unreasonable to ask you to program in an interview as if it wasn't available.",

An effective implementation order is f1, f2, f3, f4. Don't implement part of f1, jump to f2, then f3, and end up coming back to f1 later. You'll lose track of what you were doing. Instead, just call the functions, explaining to the interviewer what the function does and promise that you'll implement it after you're done with your current function  This also optimizes the time you have. If you don't get to writing some of your helper functions that implement the details, the overall general solution will still be coded out in full  If the solution to a problem is already familiar to you or you can find the solution instantly, be careful not to code it directly without any explanations  There's a danger that the interviewer will think you just memorized the solution, which doesn't provide them much information about your problem solving-abilities. You should probably also tell the interviewer you know the answer from before, that you have already figured it out. They might give you another question, or you might be asked to still implement it, just explaining the solution as you go  Otherwise, take extra care to explain the constraints of the problems, the conditions that need to be satisfied for the solution to work, and the reasoning behind each part of the solution. For example, if your solution involves using a set, explain that you need constant-time access, that you don't need to store duplicate elements, that you have no values (keys only) and that order doesn't matter (unless the set implementation in your language guarantees an order)  Learn to use the accurate and precise terminology  For example, I've heard people say \"null tree\" when they meant \"empty tree\". In some cases, an empty tree is represented with a null pointer, but the term \"null\" is very language and implementation-specific  Another example is saying that you want to use an ArrayList when discussing what data structure to use. Probably you would want to say either an array or dynamic array, which conveys more information that you understand how ArrayList is implemented and what the performance implications are  The problem with language-specific terminology is that it may convey that your current understanding of programming is mostly tied to a particular language",

If they are, that's a plus for me - but if not, we might just be different people so it's not necessarily a negative thing.\n\n\nThis is possibly one of the most universal questions you can ask.\n Sometimes you don't have a question. Maybe you didn't have the time to prepare questions. Maybe you forgot. Maybe you already know everything because this is the 3rd interview with this company and you've already read through their whole website. Fear not! Just ask them to talk about themselves.\n\n\nPeople love talking about themselves, you might not need to do any work at all! This question tends to elicit longer answer, which gives you time to find a more targeted question.

I've had code review at every internship I've done, and it has helped me become a much better engineer. It helps me write better code which is more likely to stick around longer. Companies with code review have nicer code in general, which means when I change other people's code it's much more enjoyable. Lastly, when \nI\n get the chance to review other employee's code it's helped me feel like part of the team.\n\n\nDoes your code have unit tests?\n\n\nWhen you're starting out and have no idea what most of their code does yet, it'll be nice to run tests and make sure you're not breaking things you're not aware of.\n\n\nDoes your company have 1:1s? In general, what does mentorship look like?\n\n\nAt all my interships, I've had weekly 1:1s with someone who is in charge of making sure I'm having a good time and learning and stuff. I've learned so much from these conversations and they've been the highlight of my week at some internships. They also really help make sure everyone's communicating well - that I'm doing the best job I can, that my mentor is providing me with the help I need, that I'm working on things that I like, etc.\n\n\nHow is it decided what someone on the team works on next?\n\n\nTask tracking, choice in picking tasks, how often people work on something new, how progress is measured, how often do people check in with each other - this all gives me an idea of how the team works and what it might be like for me.\n\n\nHow much choice does an intern get in what they work on? What are the similarities and differences in how they're treated vs. full time engineers?\n\n\nI've had a really great time at companies where I'm treated more like a full time engineer. I like being trusted with real work and working on things that are important. I also like getting choice on what I work on, because that optimizes my chances of looking forward to going to work.\n\n\nHow are stress levels / working hours? What things are done to support employee's health?\n\n\nMy mental health is important to me. I hope it's important to them too.\n\n\nWhat are you excited about that's going on at your company right now? (product, team culture, engineering things) and what are you excited about that's coming up in the future?\n\n\nThis gives me an idea of what cool things are going on and what I might get to be a part of when I get there :)\n\n\nDoes your company sponsor visas?\n\n\nIf they're a US company, since I'm Canadian I'd need them to sponsor a J1 visa for me. I make sure to ask this early on so I'm not wasting time if they can't hire me.\n\n\nIs your product accessible? How usable is the project by folks who are blind or deaf or have low internet access?\n\n\nA lot of smaller companies aren't able to focus on these things right away, but I hope that they at least care about and are keeping it in mind in how they're building things now, so that eventually they can have a very accessible product.\n\n\nHow do you decide what the company is working on (e.g. what's built next, or what technology is being used)? Who gets input into these decisions?\n\n\nIt's really fun when I get to help make big decisions or have influence on people who make the decisions. This is easier at a smaller company though.\n\n\n[Something related to their company]\n\n\nIt's nice to have a question that's totally related to something they do that I'm curious about and want clarification on - it also shows I know stuff about them.",

But wow, that felt like a lot of money. I could buy so many Magic The Gathering Cards!\n\n\nThe second time was a research internship in the summer. It was paid minimum wage, but it more than doubled my bank account which didn't contain much.\n\n\nThe third time was half of my current salary, but I managed 4 months worth of tuition! (Tuition is cheaper in Canada)\n\n\nWhen you're a student and the most money you've made is from distributing newspapers, the first offer you get can seem like a money. If one company pays an extra 1$/hour more than the other, that's 500$ over a summer. It feels like a pretty big difference. Almost a full iPhone.\n\n\nAnd maybe it is for you. Maybe you are struggling to pay off your living expenses and would like to support your family. Do what you need to do.\n\n\nFor everyone else, keep in mind that you are doing an internship to learn, not to get rich. This isn't about how evil money is and all that. It's just that given that you are only working 3-4 months, the difference between your offers will be quite negligible in the long run in most cases. On the other hand, doing to a place with better learning opportunities will often unlock more options for future internships and full-time employment, some of which will pay more. And at that point, the difference will start to be significant, because you'll be working at that place for years. So even if money really is your end goal, try to think about it over the long run.\n\n\nAlso, most humans are quite bad at predicting what will make them happy. \nThis research on money and happiness\n has some good life advice.\n\n\nNegotiating\n\n\nAs mentioned above, internships are more about learning than making money. That being said, if you still intend to negotiate, then there's a few things to keep in mind.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the company, there's a few reasons why they might not want to raise your offer:\n1. They want to hire interns are cheaply as possible\n2. They don't have the money\n3. They can hire someone just as good as you for the same amount of money\n4. They want all their interns to be paid the same to avoid resentment\n\n\nYou should try to figure out what constraints they have to use the most effective approach in negotiating.\n\n\nIt's difficult to do anything about (1) and (2). If you can demonstrate that you are significantly more productive, you might be able to make an economic argument that they'll get so much more work out of you that it's worth the slight increase in cost, but it will be hard.\n\n\nCase (3) will often be true at well-known, competitive companies. If you don't have a truly extraordinary accomplishment, negotiating might not be seen well.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if internship salary is publicly available for a company, (4) is likely to apply. You'll have a better chance of negotiating at smaller companies with fewer interns. Your negotiation is more likely to be successful if you can give them a story that would justify the salary disparity if other interns were to ever find out. This could include: \"you have significantly more work experience\", \"you are senior\", \"you are a return intern\". You can also try \"my other offer/previous salary was higher\" though that is less likely to work for internship than full-time positions, especially at larger companies that have dedicated internship programs.\n\n\nCheck out data about salaries\n\n\n\n\nglassdoor\n\n\ntop tech internship offers, 2016\n\n\nnew grad salaries",

Did I mention yet that you should ask people questions?\n\n\nEspecially at first, since you probably don't know how most things work yet.\n\n\nWho do you ask?\n\n\nOften you'd ask your supervisor, but it's also common for people to ask questions to the #engineering slack channel (or wherever the online-chat place is with people who'd know the answer). If you have 1:1s with your supervisor you can also ask questions then. If you don't, I'd suggest to try to set them up. I also like to ask every week if I'm asking too many questions or not enough, and if they're good questions and get advice on that.\n\n\nWhat to ask?\n\n\nAnything! There's no such thing as a stupid question. There's tons of things worth learning about at any company: the business, the team dynamics, the history, the tech stack, etc.\n\n\nMost companies will have internal documents. These may be guides, how-tos, design documents, reports, etc. They might be stored in a wiki, some shared document repository like Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Quip, etc. It's worth combing through them to learn as much as you can while you're there, and as a way to find interesting things to ask. Don't rely solely on those documents to learn though, ask questions to other employees even if you've probably seen the answer in the docs. Oftentimes, written docs might be out of date, lack some essential context, hide the fact that people disagreed on the issue, etc.\n\n\nHow many questions is too much?\n\n\nThis is a trick question. I don't think there's such thing as too many questions. It's more about:\n\n\n\n\nAre you asking questions too often?\n Some people are happy being asked things all the time, others would rather you acquire a short list and then ask them all at once and only a few times a day (that way they can focus on their own work as well as helping you out)\n\n\nAre you re-asking questions?\n If you asked something before and didn't take note of the answer and are asking again, that's annoying for the people you're asking. Try to keep track of what people are teaching you (write stuff down!) Of course sometimes things will slip your mind, but if you find yourself re-asking a question make sure to write down the answer that time at least\n\n\nCould you have just Googled it?\n Classic problem. Remember, when you ask people questions you're using their time. And they're usually happy to help you if you need the help. But if you could have found the answer easily by Google searching the error message or term you're trying to define or whatever, then you really shouldn't ask. Always look around a bit first. Some questions you can't find answers to on Google but you can find by searching company forums or documentation, so try that too if you know where those are (and if you don't... ask!)\n\n\nCould you have used standard debugging/code searching tricks to figure it out?\n If you don't know these yet, then ask someone to help you. But notice what stategies they use to figure it out. Next time you have a problem, those same strategies might help.\n\n\nHow long will it take for them to answer your question?\n This is often unknown. But try to think of how much questions will bother other ppl vs benefit you. Some quick questions are a small amount of time on their part and a huge benefit to your comfort and ability.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to ask?\n\n\nSometimes, engineers need concentration and are in the middle of working. Wearing headphones can be a signal of that, but lots of people just like to listen to music and are fine being tapped on the shoulder, it varies by individual. Generally, technical questions that are essential for you to do your job are appropriate to ask at any time unless the engineer is really busy. Sending an email or instant message is often the way to go since it allows people to finish what they're in the middle of before answering your question.\n\n\nRudi: Lunch time tends to be a great time to ask more general questions, since people aren't focused on their work. It's a great way to get to know people, to hear their personal stories, to learn tidbits about the company, etc. There's a networking benefit to it, and a personal growth benefit to it from getting to know your coworkers better. Not every single lunch will yield something interesting, and you might not always feel like mingling - sometimes I don't feel like chatting. However, consider giving it a try, especially at the beginning of the internship. During my first internship, it didn't occur to me to make an effort, and I definitely missed out on a lot.\n\n\nAt what point of trying to find the answer should you ask?\n\n\n\n\nI remember an intern telling me once that he'd been stuck on something for a week now and barely made progress, but he didn't want to ask for help. That's ridiculous to me.\n\n\nIf you have no idea how to find the answer (and you've tried to figure it out for a little bit) you should ask. At some point, you're just sitting around and not doing anything at all and that doesn't help anyone\n\n\nIf the problem is stopping you from moving forward and you have no idea what to do next (this is a terrifying thing for me still) - ASK SOMEONE\n\n\nYou should come up with a standard with your supervisor/mentor - often I've been told that if I've been stuck and making no progress for 20-30 minutes, then I should ask for help\n\n\nOne helpful tip I've been given is to write down all the things I tried in those 20-30 minutes, so that when I ask someone for help they both (1) know what I've tried and learned about the problem, so they don't retry those things or refigure out anything (2) know that I've actually given the problem a solid attempt\n\n\nRemember, the faster you learn what's up and how to do stuff, the more good work you'll do\n\n\n\n\nHow to learn from the questions you ask\n\n\nIf you ask good questions and learn from them, you can eventually ask less (or at least, more experienced) questions.\n\n\nWhen you don't know how to figure something out and have to ask someone, also ask how they would have found the answer if they were you - maybe you'll learn about some good company resource for answering questions, or learn how to Google something more effectively.\n\n\nGood things to ask questions about\n\n\nYou're trying to learn two main things (and they overlap):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow the code works and all the software\n\n\n\n\nwhat tools/technologies are used?\n\n\nwhat are the style guidelines? are there standards for how to write pretty code?\n\n\nhow much testing should you add and how is that done?\n\n\nhow fast should you be finishing things? how much of a perfectionist (at the cost of time) should you be?\n\n\nhow does code get from being written to being live in the product?\n\n\nhow are bugs reported?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow people work\n\n\n\n\nwhat things do they talk about? what are their social norms?\n\n\ndo they talk in person? or over slack?\n\n\ndo they like it quiet? do they like to be undisturbed and only talk at lunch?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that interns often get a lot of love for how they question things and bring in new energy, so don't be afraid to be you and be something different from what everyone else does. ...but there's some balance in that you want people to like you and enjoy working with you. So you want to fit into their social norms but also challenge them \nshrug\n :p",
