## Finding companies to apply to

### Lists of hiring companies

You can often find lists online of companies hiring for summer internships. Internships at other times of the year can be trickier, but you can always email companies that do summer internships and ask if they'll hire at other times of the year.

- TODO: add some links to lists people often use (idk, can some people recommend? I haven't used these much)

### Join Facebook groups (and mailing lists, slack channels, whatever is out there) that have job postings.

- etc... you should also check out intern groups relevant to your school! they probably exist


### Google it

Sometimes I just google "hiring interns" (usually adding a preferred location and/or an industry I'd like to work in) and see what shows up! This works pretty well too

### Your friends

Ask your friends where they've worked and what companies they'd recommend and how to apply to there. I bet they'd be happy to tell you about their experience and help you through the application process!

### Your peers

You can also ask advice from people in your classes or that go to your school that you don't know! Be mindful that they might not have time to help you out, but my opinion is that it doesn't hurt to ask as long as you're okay with the possibility that they don't have the time/energy/interest to reply.
