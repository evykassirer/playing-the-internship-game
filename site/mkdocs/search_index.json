Yes, this is early. Yes, this is too early. Yes, it's ridiculous. The more you wait, the more likely slots will get filled up. That's why we recommend applying when recruiting season starts. If you wait until January, the intern class could be full.\n\n\nNote that the intern class \ncould\n be full. It won't necessarily be. If, for any reason, you are applying after New Years, there are still plenty of chances of getting an internship. We only mean that you could lose out on a few opportunities. Although getting an internship at top companies is competitive, there are probably more jobs than applicants in the industry overall. We're lucky to be in tech because of how many job opportunities there are!\n\n\nHow long a company will accept summer internship application is very circumstantial and will change from year to year. There's no general rule that will always be true. However, understanding the situation of different companies could guide you in targeting your efforts:\n\n\n\n\nMedium and large tech companies\n. Well-known tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, Airbnb, etc have dedicated recruiting teams, with each individual recruiters assigned to different universities. Due to their large size, their dedicated internship programs, and the large number of applicants, they need to plan well in advance. This often means that they will have a certain number of intern slots (rough or exact), sometimes split amongst different universities. They may leave a few spare slots for late applicants but don't count on it. You should probably apply to those when they start coming to campus in September/October. They tend to be in a hurry to recruit since they compete against each other for the best students.\n\n\nStartups\n. (Check out \nAngelList\n). They could be the opposite. Their business is very uncertain and their hiring capacity, needs, projects, business goals, etc, tend to change randomly and quickly. They might only know for sure if they can afford an intern when it's a month or two before the internship would start. While not all startups hire interns, it's worth reaching out to them. We often hear stories of students getting a job at a cool startup at the last minute, right after a slot opened up because the startup got funding (also at the last minute).\n\n\nSmaller companies\n. There are many respectable companies, tech or non-tech, that only have a few dozen employees and can only hire a few interns. They don't have the resources to go campus recruiting and prefer to avoid competing head-on with big-name companies. You may have to send out a lot of emails but many of them will hire later. A lot of these companies might be local, so it's useful to search for tech companies in particular cities.\n\n\nNon-tech companies\n. Similarly, there are many companies that hire interns for programming positions but don't have the prestige of large tech companies. Think banks for example. They might even have a lot of internships slots, but they won't get filled as quickly. Keep in mind, just because a company isn't famous in tech doesn't mean it doesn't have good learning opportunities!\n\n\n\"We don't have a fixed number of slots\"\n. Some companies will say that, and they are probably telling the truth. However, the thing you have to keep in mind is that no company has an unlimited capacity to hire interns. Even if they had an unlimited monetary budget, they still need to find full-time employees capable and willing to be intern mentors, as well as projects to give interns. For that reason, every additional intern past a certain number will strain their capacity to provide a good internship experience. I've been to a company that doesn't have an intern quota, but they become more and more picky over time. The unlimited clause is really for \"just in case an amazing candidate shows up at the last minute\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidenote: Why do companies hire so early? This is a case of \"market unraveling\", discussed by economic Alvin Roth in \"Who Gets What, and Why\". In matching markets, there is an incentive for market participants to trade before the just a little before the market opens, when everyone starts trading. In the job market, this means both job seekers and job providers want to start \"trading\" (accept an offer) just a little before the market \"opens\" (recruiting season). The idea is that if a company gives an offer early, the applicant won't have as many competing offers and is more likely to take it. Unfortunately, this means that the recruiting season moves earlier and earlier (until it hits the starts of the school year, where it can't really move earlier than that).\n\n\n\n\nInternships outside the summer\n\n\nIf you're applying for internships outside of the traditional summer timeline (or you live on the side of the world where summer isn't May-August but want to do your summer internship in the northern hemisphere), 4 months before is probably plenty of time. If you're a Waterloo student and have an internship for 4 months then school for 4 months, and then another internship - I'd recommend applying during the internship and not during school. Interviews during midterms are just too much. It's an amazing feeling to already have a job while watching all your peers stress out about job apps ;D\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that companies rarely have intern positions posted on their website outside of standard intern season.

            "text": "How to apply\n\n\nOnline form applications\n\n\nSome companies have a form you fill out and attach your resume to, and this is how you apply to their jobs. Sometimes this is the only way to apply to a company, because they want to keep all the applications together in their system.\n\n\nHowever, this is often not the best way to apply. From the company's perspective, applications received online are lower in quality on average and provide the least amount of information about the applicant. This means that they are less likely to get back to online applicants than applicants they learned about from other places (see below). Many many many people are applying for internships and it's a lot of work to get through all those resumes and select who to interview. Often many applications are just never looked at.\n\n\nApplying online is definitely worth a shot, but not my recommended method if you can avoid it.\n\n\nTalk to the recruiter (or an engineer) in person somehow\n\n\nThis can be at an info session, career fair, intern event, open house, etc. If you can talk to someone that will remember you and give you priority in hiring (in the huge pile of applications they have to go through) then you've succeeded. Internally, recruiters give higher weight to applications submitted by an employee at the company.\n\n\nBut realize that every other student they're talking to is also trying to be remembered. Do what you can to make yourself stand out.\n\n\nTo do so, it helps to show that you are interested in \nthat\n company specifically. Don't just \nsay\n that you're interested, words are cheap. Take \naction\n by doing a little bit of research about the company. That will allow you to ask a question that shows your interest. For example, you can ask them about a project that the company has recently open-sourced, a blog post that they have recently published, etc.\n\n\nMaybe send a followup email to say it was nice to meet them and let them know you're excited about applying there.\n\n\nEmail/message someone that works there\n\n\nIdeally this is someone you already met before, but it doesn't have to be. I've gotten an internship from messaging someone on Facebook (with mutual friends) that worked somewhere I wanted to work. I've gotten an internship from emailing the VP engineering at a company who I'd never talked to before.\n\n\nYou can use LinkedIn (though I try to avoid it if possible). Email is probably best.\n\n\nHere are some tips for emails:\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't know who to email, or what their email address is, follow these steps:\n\n\nIf you know someone that works there, see if they can tell you who to email and what their contact is\n\n\nIf not, go on their website and look for a team page. If you can figure out who their lead engineer or recruiter is, you can try emailing them.\n\n\nIf there's nothing there, go on LinkedIn and search for people that work at that company\n\n\nIf all you have is a name but not the email, go to a email verifier site (e.g. \nhttps://email-checker.net/\n or \nhttp://verify-email.org/\n) and see if firstName@company.com works (most of time that'll be it!) I also like to check that asdasdf@company.com doesn't work since sometimes any email at their domain will come out positive\n\n\nTry to make the subject line stand out while still including internship in it. Remember, \"summer internship at \n\" is likely to be everyone else's email subject too. I like to include \"Waterloo\" in the subject because a lot of companies know and love Waterloo (and this gives me a lot of privilege in applying to jobs!)\n\n\nThe body of the email is the cover letter. And then you attach your resume to it. \nI really like this Quora example of what the email can look like\n\n\nYou can use email tracker extensions (if you do a Google search for that, you should get a few to choose from) to fairly reliably tell you when people open your emails. Sometimes the person I send an email to opens it, reads it, reads it later that day, then never replies.

Sometimes this is the only way to apply to a company, because they want to keep all the applications together in their system.  However, this is often not the best way to apply. From the company's perspective, applications received online are lower in quality on average and provide the least amount of information about the applicant. This means that they are less likely to get back to online applicants than applicants they learned about from other places (see below). Many many many people are applying for internships and it's a lot of work to get through all those resumes and select who to interview. Often many applications are just never looked at.

Do what you can to make yourself stand out.  To do so, it helps to show that you are interested in  that  company specifically. Don't just  say  that you're interested, words are cheap. Take  action  by doing a little bit of research about the company. That will allow you to ask a question that shows your interest. For example, you can ask them about a project that the company has recently open-sourced, a blog post that they have recently published, etc.  Maybe send a followup email to say it was nice to meet them and let them know you're excited about applying there.",

I've gotten an internship from messaging someone on Facebook (with mutual friends) that worked somewhere I wanted to work. I've gotten an internship from emailing the VP engineering at a company who I'd never talked to before.  You can use LinkedIn (though I try to avoid it if possible). Email is probably best.  Here are some tips for emails:   If you don't know who to email, or what their email address is, follow these steps:  If you know someone that works there, see if they can tell you who to email and what their contact is  If not, go on their website and look for a team page. If you can figure out who their lead engineer or recruiter is, you can try emailing them.  If there's nothing there, go on LinkedIn and search for people that work at that company  If all you have is a name but not the email, go to a email verifier site (e.g.  https://email-checker.net/  or  http://verify-email.org/ ) and see if firstName@company.com works (most of time that'll be it!) I also like to check that asdasdf@company.com doesn't work since sometimes any email at their domain will come out positive  Try to make the subject line stand out while still including internship in it. Remember, \"summer internship at  \" is likely to be everyone else's email subject too. I like to include \"Waterloo\" in the subject because a lot of companies know and love Waterloo (and this gives me a lot of privilege in applying to jobs!)  The body of the email is the cover letter. And then you attach your resume to it.  I really like this Quora example of what the email can look like  You can use email tracker extensions (if you do a Google search for that, you should get a few to choose from) to fairly reliably tell you when people open your emails. Sometimes the person I send an email to opens it, reads it, reads it later that day, then never replies. In that scenario I'll send a followup email saying I know their inbox is busy and so I just want to see if they have any updates for me.

Here I'll write about the things I look for when critiquing/writing resumes, but keep in mind it's just my own preference (and I'll try to explain why I feel that way). The main goal of a resume is to advertise yourself as well as possible, so if you feel you can do that better by not following my advice, then go for it!\n\n\nWhy resumes are important\n\n\nThis is only the first step to applying for jobs.\u200aIf you have a weak resume, you don\u2019t even get to the interview part (even if you're super qualified!). So having a good resume is very important. Folks that are hiring often spend only a few seconds looking at your resume, so knowing what they're expecting to see and how to impress them is essential for getting your job.\n\n\nKey goals\n\n\n\n\nGoal: prove you're qualified and would be nice to work with\n\n\nHow you'll do it:\n\n\nmake your resume easy to scan\n\n\nclearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart early!\n\n\nStart on your resume at least a month before applying for jobs so you have time to refine it to be awesome.\n\n\nGet people to critique your resume\n\n\nThis is a verrry important step and why it's good to start early. Go to resume critique sessions if your school holds them and ask your peers or more folks to look over your resume. Post your resume on Facebook and just keep asking people to edit it. I know it's scary to expose yourself like that, but having other people look over your resume is so so useful and helpful. If you can push your comfort levels a little, I think it will be worth it. If other students are critical of your resume, it can be a little disappointing but otherwise, no harm is done. If a recruiter is critical of your resume, you won't get the job and won't even know why!\n\n\nSections in your resume\n\n\nHeader\n\n\n\n\nHere you'll want to put your name, email, and GitHub (if you have one)\n\n\nIf you have a website, link to it\n\n\nMany people put their phone number here, but I don't like being called out of the blue so I don't put my number on my resume - if they need it they can email me and ask for it\n\n\nDon't put your address - no one will mail you in this day and age, and it takes up a bunch of space\n\n\nIf you're early in your education, don't put your term/year/graduation date in the header - it gives you less cred right off the bat (you can put it in the education section lower down)\n\n\n\n\nWork experience\n\n\n\n\nThis should go at the top if you have relevant experience\n\n\nIf you have some work experience, but it's not relevant to tech, you might want to put it on your resume anyways. Put anything tech related above your work experience, and if there's still a bunch of space left, talk about the jobs you've had in the recent past and the skills you used there. There are probably things you did that have skills that translate to working a tech job - leadership, navigating new situations, problem solving, working under pressure, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nWhere this goes depends on how well known your school is and how much it'll help sell you compared to your other projects. In general, the order of sections on your resume should go from most impressive (and therefore likely to get you to the next stage) to least impressive, since whoever is reading your resume will likely scan it from top to bottom and might make a decision before they get to the bottom\n\n\nIn general, even if you're from a top school, the name of your school is less interesting than other things you've done\n\n\nIf you're applying through a school specific application process (e.g. Waterloo's coop system), definitely put it near the bottom. Everyone has the same education which not only means that it doesn't make your resume stand out at all, it's basically redundant information\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills.\n\n\nSee \nthe page on side projects\n for more info\n\n\nIf you have a lot of projects, pick your favourite 3-4 for your resume; it might seem like having 7 projects looks impressive but unless they're all super impressive it just looks like filler - on your resume you always want quality over quantity\n\n\n\n\nAwards / Scholarships\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any impressive looking awards/scholarships, definitely mention them\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer experience\n\n\n\n\nThis is especially helpful if you have less work experience\n\n\nIn my first year of school, I volunteered at some CS workshops (less than a day's commitment each) and put those on my resume\n\n\n\n\nSmall section for your other interests\n\n\n\n\nI like to put that I sing in choirs and involved with certain clubs - it's important to me to have a life outside of CS-y things, and many employers appreciate this too. Some will talk about them a bit during interviews to break the ice!\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: You don't need all these sections and don't have to do them the way I advise!! Think about what skills you have that you can bring to this job, and find the things in your life that most prove you're qualified and figure out the best way to organize those things on your resume. Everyone is different, so everyone has a slightly different resume that will advertise them best.\n\n\nI'd recommend checking out other people's resumes too, as some of them have sections in their resumes that I don't personally use - these are just the sections that I like and work best for me.\n\n\nShow don't tell\n\n\nAs much as possible, don't list your skills without context proving you have them. Anyone can write \"good communicator\" on their resume, and unless you talk about something you did that needed very good communication skills, that line is essentially useless. In general, just don't list \"good communicator\" as a skill and instead talk about your communication skills when you talk about your experience. This is also true for a lot of soft skills such as \"effective team member\" or \"strong personal leadership\".\n\n\nSimilarily, show that you know programming languages by mentioning them in the work you've done with them and don't just list a bunch of them at the top of your resume. It can be useful to have them all in one place of course. But ideally, languages/technologies/acronyms that you put in a list should also appear elsewhere on your resume.\n\n\nWe say ideally because you might have dabbled in some new technology just to try it (e.g. some framework, language, programming tool, API, etc). You might not have completed a project with it and don't know how you'd write about it on your resume. However, you probably still learned something from it and that still signals to the employers that you can learn on your own which is great \nsee side projects\n. It's fine to include them, as long as you are able to explain how you've used them during an interview if asked. In general, you should be able to talk about anything on your resume during an interview.\n\n\nLength\n\n\nOne page is generally considered best, but I've had a two page resume in the past and know plenty of people that have done well with two page resumes. In general, I'd say if you have a two page resume, you should make sure it's okay if they only read the first page (i.e. the second page is like \"bonus extra stuff about me\").\n\n\nI like the idea of the one page resume because (1) people might not look at it long enough to even see the second page and (2) if you spread out your information accross two pages, you'll probably have less concentration of the good stuff. If you have a 2+ page resume, pick your best selling points accross those multiple pages and put just those on one page.\n\n\nIn general, it might seem like writing more will make you seem more impressive, but if you write tons and tons only to fill space, it won't be impressive because it will be obvious that it's just filler. Short resumes clearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications and are easier for a recruiter or potential employer to scan and understand. You do not want to dilute your impressive accomplishments in a sea of boring details!\n\n\nHow do you know if you're being too verbose? If you do have a two-page resume, you should definitely at least do the exercise of shortening it until it fits into one page. Just think of it as a way to practice being concise, and ask your friends to cross out what they think is the least interesting if needed. You might not like the end result and decide not to keep it. That's fine. But you might also find out that it works just fine.\n\n\nFor more tips on shortening resumes, see \nresume information density\n.\n\n\nHow to talk about things\n\n\n\n\nuse action verbs - they help describe the skills you've used, and starting bullet points with them helps keep your descriptions short and powerful - Google \"action verbs\" to find a bunch of lists of words to use\n\n\nadd dates when possible - for work experience, projects, volunteering, etc.\n\n\nbullet points should be concise and easy to scan, so ideally only one line long and rarely longer than two lines\n\n\nif you have more than 4 bullet points for one section, it'll become a big block of text and will become harder to scan as well. You should rarely need that many bullet points\n\n\n\n\nFormatting\n\n\nConsistency:\n\n\n\n\nuse periods at the end of bullet points or don't, but don't mix them\n\n\nmake sure your dates are in the same format (e.g. Aug 2017 or September '17)\n\n\nin general, the way you format each section and the way you talk about things should be consistent - this makes it easy to find information and to scan your resume\n\n\nin case you're thinking this right now - yes I could have better consistency in this guide because I'm not alawys doing the things I literally just mentioned ...but it's a lot harder for a thing this big and I guess I don't care enough ^.^\n\n\n\n\nGrammar:\n- \nIt matters a lot\n\n- One more reason to get your resume reviewed by peers\n\n\nKeep it simple:\n\n\n\n\nThe more different formatting styles there are (bold, italics, different text sizes, different fonts, different colours, use of capital letters) the more work your brain does to make sense of it all. Having a few styles is helpful for differentiating headings/bullet points/important words (if you want), but keep it minimal or your resume becomes harder to scan\n\n\n\n\nLink to stuff!\n\n\nI'm all about hyperlinks everywhere.\n\n\nIf you have projects on GitHub (if you don't, but have proejcts, make an account and put them on GitHub!) link to it at the top of your resume, but also link to your project in that section on your resume.\n\n\nIf you've written a blog post about a project, link to it. If you have a website, link to it at the top of your resume. Add your linkedin. Add your email. Make it all clickable! If you worked at a company that has a website, link to that too.\n\n\nIf you really want someone to be able to visit your link, even if they've printed your resume, make a short link (so it's easier to copy out) and explictly paste it in your resume. In other places you can just hyperlink text as bonus information if someone happens to hover over that area.\n\n\nDo not overoptimize\n\n\nAlthough resumes are super important, there will be diminishing returns on the amount of time you spend optimizing your resume. If people don't seem to be making major suggestions anymore after a few rounds of review, maybe it's time to move on.\n\n\nDon't forget: the advice presented here is about presenting your existing accomplishments effectively. But time that you spend optimizing your resume could also be spent generating stuff to put on your resume, which is more valuable in the long run! (learning a new language, making a project, etc)\n\n\nMisc\n\n\nMake sure you can print your resume\n\n\n\n\nMargins should be wide enough that things aren't cut off.\n\n\nIf you use colour, make sure it prints clearly enough in black and white.\n\n\n\n\nOn how old your points can be\n\n\nOnce you're 2 years into university, I'd say don't talk about high school at all unless (1) you have very few things to say about your last two years or (2) your high school accomplishments are extremely impressive\n\n\nMore resources about resumes\n\n\n\n\nsomething I wrote a while ago about resumes\n (there's some stuff I haven't put here yet)\n\n\nmy resume if you're curious what it looks like\n\n\ntips from Gayle McDowell",

This is also true for a lot of soft skills such as \"effective team member\" or \"strong personal leadership\".  Similarily, show that you know programming languages by mentioning them in the work you've done with them and don't just list a bunch of them at the top of your resume. It can be useful to have them all in one place of course. But ideally, languages/technologies/acronyms that you put in a list should also appear elsewhere on your resume.  We say ideally because you might have dabbled in some new technology just to try it (e.g. some framework, language, programming tool, API, etc). You might not have completed a project with it and don't know how you'd write about it on your resume. However, you probably still learned something from it and that still signals to the employers that you can learn on your own which is great  see side projects . It's fine to include them, as long as you are able to explain how you've used them during an interview if asked. In general, you should be able to talk about anything on your resume during an interview.",

            "text": "One page is generally considered best, but I've had a two page resume in the past and know plenty of people that have done well with two page resumes. In general, I'd say if you have a two page resume, you should make sure it's okay if they only read the first page (i.e. the second page is like \"bonus extra stuff about me\").  I like the idea of the one page resume because (1) people might not look at it long enough to even see the second page and (2) if you spread out your information accross two pages, you'll probably have less concentration of the good stuff. If you have a 2+ page resume, pick your best selling points accross those multiple pages and put just those on one page.  In general, it might seem like writing more will make you seem more impressive, but if you write tons and tons only to fill space, it won't be impressive because it will be obvious that it's just filler. Short resumes clearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications and are easier for a recruiter or potential employer to scan and understand. You do not want to dilute your impressive accomplishments in a sea of boring details!  How do you know if you're being too verbose? If you do have a two-page resume, you should definitely at least do the exercise of shortening it until it fits into one page. Just think of it as a way to practice being concise, and ask your friends to cross out what they think is the least interesting if needed. You might not like the end result and decide not to keep it. That's fine. But you might also find out that it works just fine.  For more tips on shortening resumes, see  resume information density .",

It's important to ask some questions as a way of showing interest in the company, and identifying if the company would be suited for you.\n\n\nWhy did you decide to work here?/What do you like best at this company?/What's your story?\n\n\nIn general, I'm curious why people like this company and if the reasons they would work there are similar to reasons I'd work there. If they are, that's a plus for me - but if not, we might just be different people so it's not necessarily a negative thing.\n\n\nThis is possibly one of the most universal questions you can ask.\n Sometimes you don't have a question. Maybe you didn't have the time to prepare questions. Maybe you forgot. Maybe you already know everything because this is the 3rd interview with this company and you've already read through their whole website. Fear not! Just ask them to talk about themselves.\n\n\nPeople love talking about themselves, you might not need to do any work at all! This question tends to elicit longer answer, which gives you time to find a more targeted question. Plus, as they talk about themselves, they might say something interesting you can latch on to and converse about.\n\n\nIt's useful to have a very general question like this as your backup.\n\n\nDoes your company have code review?\n\n\nCode review is the stage between you writing code and it becoming part of a codebase. I've had code review at every internship I've done, and it has helped me become a much better engineer. It helps me write better code which is more likely to stick around longer. Companies with code review have nicer code in general, which means when I change other people's code it's much more enjoyable. Lastly, when \nI\n get the chance to review other employee's code it's helped me feel like part of the team.\n\n\nDoes your code have unit tests?\n\n\nWhen you're starting out and have no idea what most of their code does yet, it'll be nice to run tests and make sure you're not breaking things you're not aware of.\n\n\nDoes your company have 1:1s? In general, what does mentorship look like?\n\n\nAt all my interships, I've had weekly 1:1s with someone who is in charge of making sure I'm having a good time and learning and stuff. I've learned so much from these conversations and they've been the highlight of my week at some internships. They also really help make sure everyone's communicating well - that I'm doing the best job I can, that my mentor is providing me with the help I need, that I'm working on things that I like, etc.\n\n\nHow is it decided what someone on the team works on next?\n\n\nTask tracking, choice in picking tasks, how often people work on something new, how progress is measured, how often do people check in with each other - this all gives me an idea of how the team works and what it might be like for me.\n\n\nHow much choice does an intern get in what they work on? What are the similarities and differences in how they're treated vs. full time engineers?\n\n\nI've had a really great time at companies where I'm treated more like a full time engineer. I like being trusted with real work and working on things that are important. I also like getting choice on what I work on, because that optimizes my chances of looking forward to going to work.\n\n\nHow are stress levels / working hours? What things are done to support employee's health?\n\n\nMy mental health is important to me. I hope it's important to them too.\n\n\nWhat are you excited about that's going on at your company right now? (product, team culture, engineering things) and what are you excited about that's coming up in the future?\n\n\nThis gives me an idea of what cool things are going on and what I might get to be a part of when I get there :)\n\n\nDoes your company sponsor visas?\n\n\nIf they're a US company, since I'm Canadian I'd need them to sponsor a J1 visa for me. I make sure to ask this early on so I'm not wasting time if they can't hire me.\n\n\nIs your product accessible? How usable is the project by folks who are blind or deaf or have low internet access?\n\n\nA lot of smaller companies aren't able to focus on these things right away, but I hope that they at least care about and are keeping it in mind in how they're building things now, so that eventually they can have a very accessible product.\n\n\nHow do you decide what the company is working on (e.g. what's built next, or what technology is being used)? Who gets input into these decisions?\n\n\nIt's really fun when I get to help make big decisions or have influence on people who make the decisions. This is easier at a smaller company though.\n\n\n[Something related to their company]\n\n\nIt's nice to have a question that's totally related to something they do that I'm curious about and want clarification on - it also shows I know stuff about them.",

If this is your first job, and you can afford to not worry about how much make, I would recommend just taking what you're offered.\n\n\nOne thing to remember is cost of living. \nIn some cities the cost of living is really high\n. I've heard stories of people working for startups in SF and making net negative money after paying rent.\n\n\nIf you have work experience and you're being offered less than you've made before, I would consider letting the company know that: \"I'm really excited about your offer, but I just wanted to let you know that in the past I've been paid \n. Would it be possible to bring my compensation to a similar level?\"\n\n\nAlso, if you have another offer that's offering more money, you can let the other companies know that - sometimes they will match it!\n\n\nWhen I ask for more money, I not to make it seem like it's a strong deciding factor for me (because it's not) but that it's just something I'm thinking about.\n\n\nIt's better to talk about salary on the phone (I know, phone calls suck - but this is how people do it and it'll probably give you the best chance. Write a script, it'll help)\n\n\nHow much is a dollar worth?\n\n\nSome advice from Rudi:\n\n\nThe first time I was paid for work other than mowing the lawn for my parents, it was a mere 200$ for some contract work on the Internet. But wow, that felt like a lot of money. I could buy so many Magic The Gathering Cards!\n\n\nThe second time was a research internship in the summer. It was paid minimum wage, but it more than doubled my bank account which didn't contain much.\n\n\nThe third time was half of my current salary, but I managed 4 months worth of tuition! (Tuition is cheaper in Canada)\n\n\nWhen you're a student and the most money you've made is from distributing newspapers, the first offer you get can seem like a money. If one company pays an extra 1$/hour more than the other, that's 500$ over a summer. It feels like a pretty big difference. Almost a full iPhone.\n\n\nAnd maybe it is for you. Maybe you are struggling to pay off your living expenses and would like to support your family. Do what you need to do.\n\n\nFor everyone else, keep in mind that you are doing an internship to learn, not to get rich. This isn't about how evil money is and all that. It's just that given that you are only working 3-4 months, the difference between your offers will be quite negligible in the long run in most cases. On the other hand, doing to a place with better learning opportunities will often unlock more options for future internships and full-time employment, some of which will pay more. And at that point, the difference will start to be significant, because you'll be working at that place for years. So even if money really is your end goal, try to think about it over the long run.\n\n\nAlso, most humans are quite bad at predicting what will make them happy. \nThis research on money and happiness\n has some good life advice.\n\n\nNegotiating\n\n\nAs mentioned above, internships are more about learning than making money. That being said, if you still intend to negotiate, then there's a few things to keep in mind.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the company, there's a few reasons why they might not want to raise your offer:\n1. They want to hire interns are cheaply as possible\n2. They don't have the money\n3. They can hire someone just as good as you for the same amount of money\n4. They want all their interns to be paid the same to avoid resentment\n\n\nYou should try to figure out what constraints they have to use the most effective approach in negotiating.\n\n\nIt's difficult to do anything about (1) and (2). If you can demonstrate that you are significantly more productive, you might be able to make an economic argument that they'll get so much more work out of you that it's worth the slight increase in cost, but it will be hard.\n\n\nCase (3) will often be true at well-known, competitive companies. If you don't have a truly extraordinary accomplishment, negotiating might not be seen well.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if internship salary is publicly available for a company, (4) is likely to apply. You'll have a better chance of negotiating at smaller companies with fewer interns. Your negotiation is more likely to be successful if you can give them a story that would justify the salary disparity if other interns were to ever find out. This could include: \"you have significantly more work experience\", \"you are senior\", \"you are a return intern\". You can also try \"my other offer/previous salary was higher\" though that is less likely to work for internship than full-time positions, especially at larger companies that have dedicated internship programs.\n\n\nCheck out data about salaries\n\n\n\n\nglassdoor\n\n\ntop tech internship offers, 2016\n\n\nnew grad salaries",

Maybe you are struggling to pay off your living expenses and would like to support your family. Do what you need to do.  For everyone else, keep in mind that you are doing an internship to learn, not to get rich. This isn't about how evil money is and all that. It's just that given that you are only working 3-4 months, the difference between your offers will be quite negligible in the long run in most cases. On the other hand, doing to a place with better learning opportunities will often unlock more options for future internships and full-time employment, some of which will pay more. And at that point, the difference will start to be significant, because you'll be working at that place for years. So even if money really is your end goal, try to think about it over the long run.  Also, most humans are quite bad at predicting what will make them happy.  This research on money and happiness  has some good life advice.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, internships are more about learning than making money. That being said, if you still intend to negotiate, then there's a few things to keep in mind.  From the perspective of the company, there's a few reasons why they might not want to raise your offer:\n1. They want to hire interns are cheaply as possible\n2. They don't have the money\n3. They can hire someone just as good as you for the same amount of money\n4. They want all their interns to be paid the same to avoid resentment  You should try to figure out what constraints they have to use the most effective approach in negotiating.  It's difficult to do anything about (1) and (2). If you can demonstrate that you are significantly more productive, you might be able to make an economic argument that they'll get so much more work out of you that it's worth the slight increase in cost, but it will be hard.  Case (3) will often be true at well-known, competitive companies. If you don't have a truly extraordinary accomplishment, negotiating might not be seen well.  As a rule of thumb, if internship salary is publicly available for a company, (4) is likely to apply. You'll have a better chance of negotiating at smaller companies with fewer interns. Your negotiation is more likely to be successful if you can give them a story that would justify the salary disparity if other interns were to ever find out. This could include: \"you have significantly more work experience\", \"you are senior\", \"you are a return intern\". You can also try \"my other offer/previous salary was higher\" though that is less likely to work for internship than full-time positions, especially at larger companies that have dedicated internship programs.",

Did I mention yet that you should ask people questions?\n\n\nEspecially at first, since you probably don't know how most things work yet.\n\n\nWho do you ask?\n\n\nOften you'd ask your supervisor, but it's also common for people to ask questions to the #engineering slack channel (or wherever the online-chat place is with people who'd know the answer). If you have 1:1s with your supervisor you can also ask questions then. If you don't, I'd suggest to try to set them up. I also like to ask every week if I'm asking too many questions or not enough, and if they're good questions and get advice on that.\n\n\nWhat to ask?\n\n\nAnything! There's no such thing as a stupid question. There's tons of things worth learning about at any company: the business, the team dynamics, the history, the tech stack, etc.\n\n\nMost companies will have internal documents. These may be guides, how-tos, design documents, reports, etc. They might be stored in a wiki, some shared document repository like Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Quip, etc. It's worth combing through them to learn as much as you can while you're there, and as a way to find interesting things to ask. Don't rely solely on those documents to learn though, ask questions to other employees even if you've probably seen the answer in the docs. Oftentimes, written docs might be out of date, lack some essential context, hide the fact that people disagreed on the issue, etc.\n\n\nHow many questions is too much?\n\n\nThis is a trick question. I don't think there's such thing as too many questions. It's more about:\n\n\n\n\nAre you asking questions too often?\n Some people are happy being asked things all the time, others would rather you acquire a short list and then ask them all at once and only a few times a day (that way they can focus on their own work as well as helping you out)\n\n\nAre you re-asking questions?\n If you asked something before and didn't take note of the answer and are asking again, that's annoying for the people you're asking. Try to keep track of what people are teaching you (write stuff down!) Of course sometimes things will slip your mind, but if you find yourself re-asking a question make sure to write down the answer that time at least\n\n\nCould you have just Googled it?\n Classic problem. Remember, when you ask people questions you're using their time. And they're usually happy to help you if you need the help. But if you could have found the answer easily by Google searching the error message or term you're trying to define or whatever, then you really shouldn't ask. Always look around a bit first. Some questions you can't find answers to on Google but you can find by searching company forums or documentation, so try that too if you know where those are (and if you don't... ask!)\n\n\nCould you have used standard debugging/code searching tricks to figure it out?\n If you don't know these yet, then ask someone to help you. But notice what stategies they use to figure it out. Next time you have a problem, those same strategies might help.\n\n\nHow long will it take for them to answer your question?\n This is often unknown. But try to think of how much questions will bother other ppl vs benefit you. Some quick questions are a small amount of time on their part and a huge benefit to your comfort and ability.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to ask?\n\n\nSometimes, engineers need concentration and are in the middle of working. Wearing headphones can be a signal of that, but lots of people just like to listen to music and are fine being tapped on the shoulder, it varies by individual. Generally, technical questions that are essential for you to do your job are appropriate to ask at any time unless the engineer is really busy. Sending an email or instant message is often the way to go since it allows people to finish what they're in the middle of before answering your question.\n\n\nRudi: Lunch time tends to be a great time to ask more general questions, since people aren't focused on their work. It's a great way to get to know people, to hear their personal stories, to learn tidbits about the company, etc. There's a networking benefit to it, and a personal growth benefit to it from getting to know your coworkers better. Not every single lunch will yield something interesting, and you might not always feel like mingling - sometimes I don't feel like chatting. However, consider giving it a try, especially at the beginning of the internship. During my first internship, it didn't occur to me to make an effort, and I definitely missed out on a lot.\n\n\nAt what point of trying to find the answer should you ask?\n\n\n\n\nI remember an intern telling me once that he'd been stuck on something for a week now and barely made progress, but he didn't want to ask for help. That's ridiculous to me.\n\n\nIf you have no idea how to find the answer (and you've tried to figure it out for a little bit) you should ask. At some point, you're just sitting around and not doing anything at all and that doesn't help anyone\n\n\nIf the problem is stopping you from moving forward and you have no idea what to do next (this is a terrifying thing for me still) - ASK SOMEONE\n\n\nYou should come up with a standard with your supervisor/mentor - often I've been told that if I've been stuck and making no progress for 20-30 minutes, then I should ask for help\n\n\nOne helpful tip I've been given is to write down all the things I tried in those 20-30 minutes, so that when I ask someone for help they both (1) know what I've tried and learned about the problem, so they don't retry those things or refigure out anything (2) know that I've actually given the problem a solid attempt\n\n\nRemember, the faster you learn what's up and how to do stuff, the more good work you'll do\n\n\n\n\nHow to learn from the questions you ask\n\n\nIf you ask good questions and learn from them, you can eventually ask less (or at least, more experienced) questions.\n\n\nWhen you don't know how to figure something out and have to ask someone, also ask how they would have found the answer if they were you - maybe you'll learn about some good company resource for answering questions, or learn how to Google something more effectively.\n\n\nGood things to ask questions about\n\n\nYou're trying to learn two main things (and they overlap):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow the code works and all the software\n\n\n\n\nwhat tools/technologies are used?\n\n\nwhat are the style guidelines? are there standards for how to write pretty code?\n\n\nhow much testing should you add and how is that done?\n\n\nhow fast should you be finishing things? how much of a perfectionist (at the cost of time) should you be?\n\n\nhow does code get from being written to being live in the product?\n\n\nhow are bugs reported?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow people work\n\n\n\n\nwhat things do they talk about? what are their social norms?\n\n\ndo they talk in person? or over slack?\n\n\ndo they like it quiet? do they like to be undisturbed and only talk at lunch?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that interns often get a lot of love for how they question things and bring in new energy, so don't be afraid to be you and be something different from what everyone else does. ...but there's some balance in that you want people to like you and enjoy working with you.

Here are some excerpts from one of my internships, to give you an idea:    Reflections:   Feeling tired and restless makes it hard to get stuff done  Only working on [my main project] makes it feel like I\u2019m not getting as much done - thinking about how variety of things making the number of things feel like more (in time and in stuff accomplished)  Nervous about people understanding the big codebase I'm writing  [my project] forward - how much to prioritize [some functionality] vs [a thing that would be good before shipping] vs code clarity      Things I did this week:   Math solver  Added basic division support  Changed the way polynomial multiplication worked  A fair bit of cleaning things  Math card  It\u2019s blue now  Has graphs for some things  Has roots for some things  Other  Helped with the study daddy spam prevention  Made a #diversity slack channel  Chatted with [some employees] about feedback culture at the company      1:1 takeaways:   Wrapping little functionality in functions is helpful for refactoring  More tests! :)  Put some time on calendar for research and testing daily  Think about different people and how they think and work and how you can most effectively work with them and convince them of your goals  New systems don't always implement easily. People have to be really behind it and get in the habit. It's hard to create change but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it.  People have must-have goals, and nice-to-have goals. Think about this when trying to encourage people to do certain things",

If you don't have 1:1s at your company, consider convincing them to have them.\n\n\nAsk questions in your 1:1s\n\n\nSometimes your manager won't come prepared with things to talk about. You can still learn a lot from them by preparing questions to ask and things to talk about. Here's \na list of questions I liked\n\n\nHow to get good feedback/advice in your 1:1s\n\n\nAsk for feedback. At every 1:1 say \"Tell me what I can be doing better. Tell me what I'm already doing well so I can keep doing it.\" It can be really hard for supervisors/mentors/etc to think of these things, so push them. Say \"I want to be better. \nHelp me\n be a better person. If you can't give me feedback or advice, it'll hurt my career and my performance during this internship\"\n\n\nAsk teammates to meet with you too sometimes, if you work with them regularly. Sometimes you don't work much with your supervisor and they won't be able to give as good feedback, so ask the people you \ndo\n work with for feedback.\n\n\nMeet regularly enough to get feedback from them. (I like weekly 1:1s)\n\n\nAnd push. I can't stress this enough. It might feel weird for them but do your best to figure out what you need to improve and then work at it.\n\n\nAt school, things you could improve are things like learning material better, studying harder, or whatever. But now you're learning people skills and technical skills\nwhich are \nWAY\n more interesting and useful. So take this opportunity you get to meet with people and ask for feedback, and try to learn as much as you can.\n\n\n(Watch your health though - some interns try to do a lot and learn a lot and then burn out, so be careful)\n\n\nOne thing that's helped me in getting feedback and keeping track of progress is keeping a \nsummary of all I've done over my intership",
