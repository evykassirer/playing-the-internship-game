# playing-the-internship-game

(NOTE: this is totally a work in progress, mostly just a brain dump right now from a day during reading week. I hope to get back to this during exams and the summer term!)

the rules, tips, and tricks I've learned on how to approach tech internships

I've collected this pile of advice thanks to many folks with more experience than me, or who came up with cool ideas I might not have thought of. These things give me an advantage and I think it's unfair that others shouldn't have that same advantage if they're motivated enough to look for advice and just don't know the same people I do. So I'm putting as much as I can remember here, and hoping that if you read this and it helps you, that you will pass this knowledge on to help others too.

This is just advice, a collection of things people have said that I've found helpful. It might not actually be the best advice, and it might not work for you. My best advice is to think critically about all the advice you get, and only do things when you have a good idea of why it might help you and think it's your best option.

I also want to note that just because I've learned that something is the most effective thing to do to get a job doesn't mean I think should be - the interview processes many companies use aren't necessarily fair or effective for evaluating how good of an employee you'd be. That's why this is a game. They create the game and you learn to play it well, and that's how you get jobs. It sucks, but I figured you should at least know how to play it well too.

If you have a question, open an issue with it and I'll try to add the answer in here somewhere. If you'd like to ask a question anonymously, or just less publicly, you can also fill out this form (TODO set up a form and have it email me when someone fills it out and then link to it).

If you have advice to add, please open a pull request!
